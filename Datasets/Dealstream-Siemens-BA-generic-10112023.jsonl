They want to be able to better service their existing clients by improving their customer success rates to help protect their renewal rates. They use Salesforce and Gong.io as well as Outreach for their early-stage lead generation. Agreed to move forward with a solution demo. They have too many disparet sales systems Want to provide a seamless unified platform expereince allowing the user to do majority of the work in one application. 17/12/2022- Sent NDA for signature. 20/12/2022- Still awaiting NDA to be returned. Also emailed Jim Jackson, head of operations, to introduce myself and Dealstream with a view to perhaps including him on the planned demo session. 23/12/2022- Emailed stakeholders to push for the NDA and to suggest suitable dates/times for the demonstration. 01/01/2023- NDA returned and the 7th January 2023 agreed as the best date for the demonstration. Emailed Ken to identify and inform us of the attendees for the session. 07/01/2023- The demo session went well. They indicated that they loved the UI/UX; however, they would need to ensure that the integration with their whole tech stack, including Gong, would be something that we could do. Need to set up a call with their team and our product management team to give them confidence that this integration work can be delivered. In addition, there was some concern around data privacy which they need their Data Privacy team to look into. I have asked them to send us their DPA, which they will hopefully do by the end of the week. 14/01/2023- Discussion Points: Conducted a comprehensive needs analysis with Account. Explored specific pain points and challenges they face. Discussed how the AI software solution could address these challenges effectively. 21/01/2023- Held a meeting to discuss data privacy and security considerations related to the AI software solution. Addressed how the solution complies with Account' data protection requirements. 22/01/2023- Held a product demo showcasing the key features and capabilities of the AI software solution.

Clarified technical aspects, integration requirements, and potential ROI that Account could expect. 07/02/2023- Presented a tailored proposal outlining the AI software solution, its benefits, and how it aligns with Account' needs. Discussed pricing options and potential implementation timelines. 14/02/2023- Customer mentioned that they are likely to go to RFP to around 5 solutions and that the RFP will be released over the next 3 weeks latest by 28th Feb 2023. I am working with the internal RFP team to assist with providing the client with an RFP template to send to the client. 21/02/2023- Sent the client the RFP template - discovered that two of the competitors are Humantics AI and FairSale. The client has not committed to using our template - still awaiting the RFP document from the client. 28/02/2023- RFP document is delayed and project stalled for a couple of weeks due to internal priorities of the stakeholder team. 07/03/2023- RFP document released. It is the customer's own template; however, I do see some similarity in many of the points in the document with our template. I suspect that they have utilized some of what I sent to them. RFP response is due in 2 weeks from now, 21st March 2023. 14/03/2023- Completing RFP documentation - still awaiting feedback from Product Marketing on our roadmap and what can be released to the customer as part of the response. Also awaiting the DPA section of the RFP to be completed by our data privacy team. 20/03/2023- Submitted RFP response this morning complete with pricing at 350K USD per annum for licenses and 200K implementation. 25/03/2023- A session has been set up and invites sent by the client to attend a Q&A regarding our response - all key stakeholders are to attend on the BA side. 27/03/2023- Q&A session went very well; we answered all of their points, and I proposed that we deliver a tailored Post-RFP workshop to take them through a configured demo covering all of their use cases. 28/03/2023- The customer has asked us to deliver the workshop on the 14th April. Working internally with the solution consulting team to prepare the demo environment. 30/03/2023- Spoken with my main champion there, Geoff Gables, VP Sales - he stated that they are currently in the process of securing budget internally - apparently, there are a few rounds of approval and the final approval meeting happens on the 21st April 2023. I asked what level of budget that they are looking to secure and they stated enough to cover the requirements of the solution - wouldn't give an exact figure. 14/04/2023- Demo session went very well - a 4-hour-long session; all stakeholders, including Economic Buyer Jim Jackson, Head of Operations, in attendance. We covered all of their main points - a few questions came up on service delivery and SOW; the next step is to build out the SOW. I proposed a Value Engineering session to build out a Proof of Value document - they accepted. Agreed to kick off the value engineering session on 21st April. 21/04/2023- Completed value engineering call, and we will have the POV document with them by the end of the week. 27/04/2023- Delivered Value Engineering POV. 27/04/2023 - Deliverd Value engineering POV. 28/04/2023- Started work on the SOW internally aiming to deliver the SOW with the final implementation program by 5th May 2023. 05/05/2023- Delivered SOW to the client - total services 195K. 07/05/2023- SOW call with the customer to discuss the timeline and project plan in more detail. 10/05/2023- Called my Champion, Geoff Gables, and asked him when the target date is for announcing VOC - he stated by the end of next week. 17/05/2023- We have been awarded VOC and have now moved into discussions with Procurement. The first call with Procurement is set for next week. 25/05/2023- Had a call with procurement who have stated that we need to look at reducing our price across the board in order for this to move forward. 26/05/2023- I discussed with internal management and we have agreed to offer a 5% discount given that our RFP price was already reduced by 20% from the list - this additional discount is tied to an end of June close date. 27/05/2023- I met with both the EC and the champion today to discuss building a Mutual Activity Plan for us all to work towards completing all outstanding items to close. 27/05/2023- Sent our MSA and Order form to the client today to process the terms through their legal team. 29/05/2023- Meeting with the Legal team and our legal team scheduled for 7/06/2023. 30/05/2023- Had a conversation with the EB, and he indicated that a clause for termination for convenience will be required - I mentioned that this is not possible due to our revenue recognition requirements and that termination for cause will be added. 07/06/2023- First legal call to discuss their points on the contract went well - we have some outstanding points around Termination for convenience and Support terms. 09/06/2023- We addressed the client's redlines and returned the contract. 10/06/2023- I built the MAP and sent the template to the client today for their review. 15/06/2023- Legal confirmed today that they are happy with the MSA and will submit it to procurement to push through the signature process. 20/06/2023- Discovered today that the signatory is on vacation until 4th July. I reiterated that our price holds until the end of June and we need to find a backup signatory. 26/06/2023- A backup signatory identified and contract in for signature with Ian Harper, COO. 30/06/2023- Contract signed today, and the Order form expected tomorrow, however, will be dated 30th June - some minor terms on the order form came up at the last minute; our Sales Ops are changing. 01/07/2023- Order form signed and PO received - Deal closed.``` identify the pain points faced by Account in its current workflows."}, {"role": "assistant","content":"The sales process is excessively complex and requires simplification.

They suggested that the sales process is too intricate and requires streamlining, in addition to an increase in the average deal size. Their goal is to improve customer success rates, allowing them to better service their current clients and safeguard their renewal rates. For their early stage lead generation, they utilize Salesforce, Gong.io, and Outreach. Gave the nod to proceed with a demonstration of the solution. They are dealing with a multitude of inconsistent sales systems. Aiming to offer a unified, seamless platform where most tasks can be performed within a single application. 17/12/2022- Dispatched the NDA for signing. 20/12/2022- I'm yet to receive the returned NDA. Additionally, I've reached out to Jim Jackson, the head of operations, to introduce myself and Dealstream, in the hopes of possibly involving him in our upcoming demo session. 23/12/2022- Wrote to stakeholders encouraging them to push for the NDA and suggesting appropriate dates and times for the demonstration. 01/01/2023- Ken was emailed following the NDA's return, with the 7th January 2023 confirmed as the optimal date for the session. He was asked to pinpoint and notify us about the demonstration attendees. 07/01/2023- The demonstration session proceeded smoothly. They expressed their satisfaction with the UI/UX, yet they stressed the need to confirm if we can integrate with their entire tech stack, including Gong. We need to arrange a conference call between their team and our product management team to assure them that the task of integration can be effectively carried out. In addition, there was some concern around data privacy which they need their Data Privacy team to look into. I've requested that they share their DPA with us, hopefully by the end of this week. 14/01/2023- Topics Covered: Carried out a detailed needs analysis with Account, examining specific aspects they struggle with. Explored how the AI software solution could rectify these issues effectively. 21/01/2023- Convened an assembly focused on deliberating over data privacy and security concerns surrounding our AI software solution. Explored how it aligns with Account' data protection guidelines. 22/01/2023- Conducted a product demo featuring the utmost features and capabilities of an AI software solution. Showed how it could be seamlessly incorporated into Account' existing systems for operational enhancement. 30/01/2023- Answered queries and alleviated concerns that emerged post the product demonstration. Explained the technical matters, integration needs, and possible return on investment that could be anticipated by Account. 07/02/2023- Outlined a customized proposal presenting the AI software solution, its advantages, and its compatibility with the specific requirements of Account. Also, conversed on pricing structures and possible execution schedules. 14/02/2023- The client noted they're considering sending RFPs to about five solutions and plan to release the RFP within the upcoming three weeks at the latest, by February 28th, 2023. I am collaborating with the internal RFP team to furnish a suitable RFP template for the client to use. 21/02/2023- Dispatched the RFP template to the client, and found out that our competitors are Humantics AI and FairSale. We're still waiting for the client's commitment to use our template and return the RFP document to us. 28/02/2023- The stakeholder team's internal priorities have caused a delay in the RFP document and stalled the project for several weeks. 07/03/2023- The RFP document has been issued, and it appears to be the customer's own template. However, I have noticed a number of similarities to our own template. I suspect that they incorporated some aspects from what I sent them. As per the schedule, the RFP response is due on 21st March 2023, which is around two weeks from today. 14/03/2023- We are still awaiting feedback from our Product Marketing team regarding our road map—information required for completing the RFP documentation. Also, our data privacy team is yet to complete the DPA section of the RFP. 20/03/2023- This morning, I submitted a RFP response that included a quote of $350K per year for licenses and $200K for implementation. 25/03/2023- An appointment has been scheduled by the client, and invitations have been dispatched for a Q&A regarding our feedback - all principal stakeholders from the BA side are expected to attend. 27/03/2023- Our Q and A session was highly successful; we addressed all their concerns. Additionally, I suggested conducting a bespoke Post RFP workshop so we could walk them through a configured demo that encapsulates all their use cases. 28/03/2023-  The customer has requested that we conduct the workshop on 14th April. We are collaborating internally with the solution consulting group to ready the demo environment. 30/03/2023- In a conversation with Geoff Gables, the VP Sales and my primary contact, he mentioned that they are still securing their internal budget. They are going through several rounds of approval and the final one is slated for 21st April 2023. When asked about the budget they're trying to secure, Geoff didn't provide an exact figure but specified it would be enough to meet the solution's requirements. 14/04/2023- The demo session was a great success - with a duration of 4 hours, all stakeholders, including our Economic Buyer Jim Jackson, the Head of Operations, were present. We discussed all their major issues and answered queries related to service delivery and SOW. The next step is to finalize the SOW. I put forth the idea of a Value Engineering session to create a Proof of Value document, which they accepted. We've agreed to initiate the Value Engineering Session on April 21st. 21/04/2023- We successfully concluded the value engineering call and plan to provide them with the POV document by the conclusion of week. 27/04/2023 - Presented a point of view on value engineering. 28/04/2023- Initiated in-house work on the SOW, with a goal to complete the SOW and its final implementation program by May 5th, 2023. 05/05/2023- The SOW was delivered to the client with total services amounting to 195K. 07/05/2023- Call with the client to elaborate on the timeline and project plan in a SOW meeting. 10/05/2023- I spoke with my Champion, Geoff Gables, and inquired about the VOC announcement's intended date - he confirmed it should be by the end of next week. 17/05/2023- Having received the VOC award, we've now transitioned to engaging in discussions with Procurement. Our initial meeting with them is scheduled for the following week. 25/05/2023- In a conversation with the procurement department, they mentioned we have to decrease our pricing throughout all our products to progress. 26/05/2023- In consultation with internal management, it was agreed to provide a 5% additional discount if the deal is closed by the end of June. This comes after our RFP price was earlier marked down by 20% from the list price. 27/05/2023- In today's meeting with both the EC and the champion, we discussed creating a Mutual Activity Plan for closing all outstanding items. 27/05/2023- Today, send the Order form and the MSA to the client so their legal team can process the terms. 29/05/2023- The meet-up with the legal team and our own law professionals is set for 7/06/2023. 30/05/2023- During a conversation with the EB, he suggested including a termination for convenience clause. However, I expressed our inability to do so due to our revenue recognition requirements and instead, offered to include a termination for cause clause. 07/06/2023- The initial legal discussion concerning their contract points proceeded smoothly, though there are still some unresolved issues about Termination for convenience and Support terms. 09/06/2023- We dealt with the clients' redlines and gave back the contract. 10/06/2023- Today, I created the MAP and forwarded the template to the client for their perusal. 15/06/2023- Today, Legal confirmed their satisfaction with the MSA and will forward it for procurement to initiate the signing process. 20/06/2023- I found out today that the authorized signatory is away until the 4th of July. I reminded them that our price remains the same until the end of June, and we need to identify a substitute signatory. 26/06/2023- Ian Harper, the COO, has been identified as the back-up signatory and the contract is in for his signature. 30/06/2023- Today, the contract has been signed and expected to receive the order form by tomorrow, though it would be dated June 30th - last minute modifications on a few minor terms have been made by our Sales Ops. 01/07/2023- The deal is finalized - order form has been signed and purchase order obtained.``` identify the pain points faced by Account in its current workflows."}, {"role": "assistant","content":"Our sales procedure is incredibly intricate and necessitates streamlining.

They highlighted that the sales system is quite complex and needs simplification, and there is also a necessity to raise the average transaction size. They aspire to enhance the success rates of their customers to better serve their existing clients and uphold their renewal rates. They employ Salesforce and Gong.io, in addition to Outreach, for the initial stages of lead generation. Decided to pursue a demonstration of the proposed solution. The number of uncoordinated sales systems they have is overwhelming. We aim to provide a seamless, integrated platform experience that will let users handle most of their work in one application. 17/12/2022- The NDA has been sent for signature. 20/12/2022- I am still waiting for the NDA to be returned. I've also emailed Jim Jackson, who heads operations, introducing myself and Dealstream, with the intention of maybe bringing him into the scheduled demo session.  23/12/2022- Sent an email to stakeholders urging them to advocate for the NDA, as well as proposing convenient dates and times for the demonstration.  01/01/2023- he NDA was received back and it was mutually agreed upon that the best date for the demonstration would be 7th January 2023. Ken received an email to specify and give us information about those who will be attending the session. 07/01/2023- Everything went well in the demo session. While they appreciated the UI/UX, they declared that integration with their tech stack including Gong must be guaranteed. It's necessary to schedule a call with their team and our product management group to instill confidence that this integration project is feasible. In addition, there was some concern around data privacy which they need their Data Privacy team to look into.  I've urged them to transmit their DPA to us, potentially by the week's end. 14/01/2023- Key Takeaways: Undertook a thorough needs assessment involving Account. Identifying specific difficulties and obstacles they encounter. Talked about how the implementation of AI software solution could tackle these problems successfully. 21/01/2023- Had a conference where the key topic was data protection and security implications of our AI software solution. We also reviewed its compliance with the data protection needs of Account. 22/01/2023- Carried out a demonstration of a new AI software solution, highlighting its primary features and functions. Presented its potential integration into Account' current operations to improve processes. 30/01/2023- Addressed all inquiries and difficulties that cropped up after the product presentation.

Engaged in a dialogue concerning price points and potential timeframes for deployment. 14/02/2023- The customer has indicated their intention to send out RFPs to roughly 5 possible solutions. Their plan is to have the RFP sent out within the next three weeks, no later than February 28th, 2023. I am liaising with our internal RFP team to prepare a proper template for the client. 21/02/2023- The client received our RFP template, but we discovered our competition includes Humantics AI and FairSale. The client hasn't confirmed they'll use our template, and is yet to provide the RFP document. 28/02/2023- Due to the internal priorities of the stakeholder team, the project has been delayed for a couple of weeks, and so has the RFP document. 07/03/2023- We have received the RFP document which seems to be based on the customer's personal template. Interestingly, it contains several points that coincide with our template. It makes me think that they have used parts of the data I shared with them. And just to update you, the deadline to respond to the RFP is the 21st March 2023, two weeks from today. 14/03/2023- The RFP documentation is still in the process of being completed while we await feedback from Product Marketing about what components can be included in the customer response. Additionally, we are waiting for the data privacy team to finalize the DPA section of the RFP. 20/03/2023- I finalized and submitted our RFP response today, proposing an annual rate of $350K for licenses and an implementation fee of $200K. 25/03/2023-  A meeting has been established, and the client sent out invites for a Q&A on our response - all essential BA side stakeholders must attend. 27/03/2023- The Q and A session unfolded favorably and we responded to every point they had. Furthermore, I recommended that we orchestrate a customized Post RFP workshop to show them a purpose-built demo, addressing all of their use scenarios. 28/03/2023- On 14th April, as per the customer's request, we are to run a workshop. Our solution consulting team is in the process of preparing the demo environment internally. 30/03/2023- The conversation I had with my key champion, Geoff Gables who is the VP Sales, revolved around their current internal budgeting process. It appears there are several approval stages with the final approval set for 21st April 2023. They couldn't provide an exact budget but stated it would suffice to cover the solution's requirements. 14/04/2023- Our 4-hour demo session was very productive with all stakeholders present, including Jim Jackson, the Economic Buyer and Head of Operations. We addressed all the key points they raised, along with some questions about service delivery and the Statement of Work (SOW). We agreed on my proposal to develop a value engineering session to formulate a Proof of Value document. The session is scheduled to begin on April 21st. 21/04/2023- The value engineering call has been completed and we must have the POV document with them by the termination of week. 27/04/2023 - Conveyed a perspective about value engineering. 28/04/2023- Commenced internal work on the SOW, targeting to finalize with the implementation program on 5th May 2023. 05/05/2023- The client received the SOW, the cost of all services amounted to 195K. 07/05/2023- SOW call scheduled with the customer to delve deeper into the specifics of the timeline and project plan.  10/05/2023- My Champion, Geoff Gables, was contacted by me, and he stated that the target date for the VOC announcement will be by the end of the coming week.  17/05/2023- We are pleased to announce that we've been awarded the VOC, and have subsequently begun consultations with Procurement. The inaugural contact with Procurement will take place in the coming week. 25/05/2023- We just had a discussion with procurement and they informed us that price reduction across all areas is necessary for any advancement. 26/05/2023- After conferring with our internal management, we've decided to grant an extra 5% discount on the already 20%-reduced RFP price, but on the condition that the deal closes by the end of June. 27/05/2023- Constructing a Mutual Activity Plan was the main topic discussed in the meeting with the EC and the champion today, that is intended to help us resolve all outstanding items. 27/05/2023- The MSA and Order form should be sent to the client today for their legal team's processing of the terms. 29/05/2023- Both our legal team and the additional Legal team are planned to meet on 7/06/2023. 30/05/2023- When the EB and I spoke, he insisted on a termination clause for convenience. Despite this proposal, I told him it was impossible due to our revenue recognition prerequisites, but agreed to a termination clause for cause. 07/06/2023- Our first official call to talk through their points on contract was successful. However, we still have some outstanding issues regarding Termination for convenience and Support terms. 09/06/2023- The clients' redlines were addressed by us, and we returned the contract. 10/06/2023- The MAP was put together by me today, then the template was submitted to the client for their check. 15/06/2023- Legal disclosed today that they are pleased with the MSA and will deliver it to procurement for streamlining the signature process. 20/06/2023- Today I learned that the signatory is on holiday until July 4th. I emphasized again that our quote remains stable until the end of June and we are in need of a contingency signatory. 26/06/2023- The back-up signatory, Ian Harper who is COO, has accepted and is expected to sign the contract. 30/06/2023- The contract was signed today and we anticipate the order form to arrive tomorrow, yet it would bear the date of June 30th - our Sales Operations team is adjusting some minor terms that emerged in the final moments. 01/07/2023- Purchase order received and order form inked, hence the deal is sealed.``` identify the pain points faced by Account in its current workflows."}, {"role": "assistant","content":"The sales process is quite cumbersome and is in urgent need of simplification.

They pointed out that the sales operation is excessively detailed, needing streamlining, and an increase in the average deal size is also necessary. They aim to strengthen their services for existing clients by improving their customer success rates, which would also help maintain their renewal rates. Their early stage lead generation involves the use of Salesforce, Gong.io, and Outreach. Concurred to advance with showing a solution demo. They suffer from having too many unconnected sales systems. Our goal is to provide a smooth and combined platform experience where the user can accomplish much of the work in one program. 17/12/2022- Delivered the NDA for endorsement. 20/12/2022- I've yet to get a returned NDA. Moreover, I emailed Jim Jackson, the chief of operations, to present myself and Dealstream, contemplating his possible participation in our planned demo session. 23/12/2022- Reached out to stakeholders via email to lobby for the NDA and to propose optimal dates/times for the demonstration. 01/01/2023- Ken was tasked, through an email, with identifying and informing us about the attendees for the demonstration session, scheduled for the 7th January 2023 following the return of the NDA. 07/01/2023- The demo session was successful. They communicated their admiration for the UI/UX, but also emphasized the importance of a successful integration with their entire tech stack, particularly Gong. We must set a meeting with their team and our product management department to reassure them that we're capable of carrying out this integration task. In addition, there was some concern around data privacy which they need their Data Privacy team to look into. I have implored them to dispatch their DPA to us, ideally before the end of the week. 14/01/2023- Points of Discussion: Conducted a broad-based needs evaluation with Account. Discussed in detail the particular issues and struggles they deal with. Examined how an AI software solution could potentially solve these issues. 21/01/2023- Organized a discussion forum to go over issues concerning data privacy and security of the AI software solution. We also clarified how the solution fulfills Account' data safety protocols. 22/01/2023- Organized a product demonstration to showcase the distinguishing features of our AI software solution. Explained its possible integration within Account' existing systems to optimize their workflows and operations. 30/01/2023- Responded to questions and resolved issues that appeared following the product demo. Provided clarity on technical dimensions, integration demands, and prospective ROI available for Account. 07/02/2023- Provided a bespoke proposal explaining the relevance of the AI software solution, how beneficial it is, and how it matches Account' needs. Pricing options and likely implementation timelines were also discussed. 14/02/2023-  It was suggested by the customer they are planning to submit RFPs to around five solutions. It’s expected to be released over the coming three weeks, but not later than 28th Feb 2023. I'm teaming up with our in-house RFP department to create an RFP template for the client. 21/02/2023- Found out that Humantics AI and FairSale are our competitors after sending the client our RFP template. We haven't heard from them regarding their commitment to our template and we're waiting for them to return the RFP document. 28/02/2023- The project, as well as the RFP document, has been put on hold for a couple of weeks due to the internal priorities of the stakeholder team. 07/03/2023-  I've noticed that the released RFP document, even though based on the customer's own template, shares a number of similarities with ours. They may have included some aspects from the material I previously sent them. Just so it's clear, the deadline for our RFP response is 21st March 2023, which is two weeks from now. 14/03/2023-  A delay in finalizing the RFP documentation is due to us waiting for input from Product Marketing, particularly about our road map and customer-relevant details. Also, the DPA section of the RFP is still to be concluded by our data privacy department. 20/03/2023- As of this morning, our RFP response was submitted, projecting an annual licensing fee of $350K and an implementation cost of $200K. 25/03/2023- A session has been arranged by the client who also sent invites for a Q and A about our response - attendance from all critical stakeholders on the BA side is mandatory. 27/03/2023- The Q and A session went quite positively. We covered each of their queries comprehensively and I put forward the idea of a tailored Post RFP workshop to guide them through a structured demo which mirrors all their operational cases. 28/03/2023- In alignment with the customer's request, we're scheduled to deliver a workshop on the 14th of April. Our solution consulting team is working behind-the-scenes to set up the demo environment. 30/03/2023- Geoff Gables, the VP Sales, and my main contact therein confirmed they're in the midst of appraising their internal budget, which involves multiple approval steps. Their final approval conference is on 21st April 2023. Also, when questioned about the budget they are aiming to get, they indicated it would be adequate to fund the solution's requirements without disclosing the exact number. 14/04/2023- The 4-hour long demo session proceeded exceedingly well with key stakeholders such as Jim Jackson, the Economic Buyer and Head of Operations present. All the main assigned topics, many questions about service delivery as well as the SOW were addressed. The follow-up action is to construct the SOW. I suggested organizing a Value Engineering session to draft a proof of Value document, and they were in agreement. We decided to commence the Value Engineering Session on 21st April. 21/04/2023- We finished our value engineering call, and the POV document will be with them by week's end of the week. 27/04/2023 - Expressed an opinion about value engineering. 28/04/2023- Began working on the SOW in-house with an objective to wrap up with the finalized implementation program by 5th May 2023. 05/05/2023- Total services of 195K were included in the SOW delivered to the client. 07/05/2023- SOW meeting with the customer set to discuss project plan and timeline in greater detail. 10/05/2023- I asked Geoff Gables, my Champion, about our target timeline for announcing VOC – he let me know it should be by the close of next week. 17/05/2023- Next week, we'll have our first call with Procurement, which comes as a result of us being awarded VOC and initiating a dialogue with them. 25/05/2023- The procurement team has communicated in a recent call that for any forward movement, there's a need to lower our prices on a broad scale. 26/05/2023- Our meeting with the internal management resulted in an agreement to slash prices by an additional 5%. It's important to note that this is supplementary to the 20% reduction from the list price on our RFP and it applies only to deals sealed by June end. 27/05/2023- Today's meeting with the EC and the champion addressed the need to build a Mutual Activity Plan for completing any outstanding items. 27/05/2023- To initiate the process of the terms through the client's legal team, please send the Order form and MSA today. 29/05/2023- An appointment with both the Legal department and our legal squad has been arranged for 7/06/2023. 30/05/2023- The EB and I discussed a termination clause for convenience, and though he suggested it, I clarified that our revenue recognition requirements prevent it but agreed to add a termination for cause clause. 07/06/2023- The preliminary legal meeting to communicate their views on the contract was promising. Nonetheless, we still need to clarify some questions on Termination for convenience and Support terms. 09/06/2023- Having addressed the redlines from the clients, we sent back the contract. 10/06/2023- I've assembled the MAP today and dispatched the template for the client's examination. 15/06/2023- It was confirmed by Legal today that the MSA meets their needs and they will pass it to procurement for the process of signature. 20/06/2023- I discovered today that the signatory will be off until July 4th. I reasserted that our pricing is valid until the end of June, and we need an alternative signatory. 26/06/2023- The back-up signing authority has been recognized as Ian Harper, the COO, and the contract is now in for his signature. 30/06/2023- We signed the contract today, and the order form is likely to appear tomorrow, despite bearing a date of June 30th - due to last minute issues, a few minor adjustments have been made by our Sales Ops. 01/07/2023- Deal completion confirmed - Order form sanctioned and purchase order attained.``` identify the pain points faced by Account in its current workflows."}, {"role": "assistant","content":"Too much complexity is involved in the sales process, and it needs to be streamlined.

Regarding their criticisms, they mentioned that the sales process appears convoluted and thus needs optimization, furthermore the average deal size needs expansion. They're striving to upgrade their service for existing clients by enhancing the customer success rates and, in turn, securing their renewal rates. Salesforce, Gong.io, and Outreach are the platforms they use for early stage lead generation. Consented to proceed with the solution's practical demonstration. The plethora of inconsistent sales systems they have at their disposal is too much. We seek to offer a single-stop platform that enables the user to perform the lion's share of their work. 17/12/2022- Transmitted the NDA for approval. 20/12/2022- I'm currently waiting for the NDA to be returned. I also decided to introduce myself and Dealstream to Jim Jackson, the head of operations, with a thought of including him in the demo session we are planning.  23/12/2022- Emailed stakeholders to advance the NDA and suggest ideal demonstration times. 01/01/2023- After the NDA returned, we settled on the 7th January, 2023 as the appropriate date for the demonstration. An email was sent to Ken for the purpose of determining and keeping us posted about the session attendees. 07/01/2023- We accomplished a lot in the demo session. They made clear their love for the UI/UX while also stressing that integrating with their full tech stack, especially Gong, is a prerequisite. A call has to be set between our product management squad and their team, so as to convince them about the possibility of the integration work. In addition, there was some concern around data privacy which they need their Data Privacy team to look into. They've been asked by me to forward their DPA to us, hopefully before this week concludes. 14/01/2023- Agenda Items: A holistic needs review was performed in collaboration with Account, with a specific focus on their unique challenges. Delved into how incorporating an AI software solution could confidently alleviate these challenges. 21/01/2023- Undertook a meeting for the purpose of discussing data safety and confidentiality concerns tied to the use of our AI software solution. We also conversed about the solution's adherence to Account' data safeguarding rules. 22/01/2023- Facilitated a product demo, presenting the unique features of an AI software solution. Illustrated its potential for integration with Account' current systems, thereby amplifying the efficiency of their operations. 30/01/2023- Handled questions and worries that presented themselves after demonstrating the product. Explained technical characteristics, integration necessities, and the likely return on investment for Account. 07/02/2023- Showcased a made-to-order proposal laying out the AI software solution, its valuable aspects, and how it meets with the needs of Account. Talked about various pricing models and probable roll-out timelines. 14/02/2023- The customer specified plans to dispatch RFPs to an estimated five solutions, intending to release the RFP within a maximum of three weeks, by 28th Feb 2023. Currently, I'm cooperating with our internal RFP crew to supply the client with a suitable RFP model for his use. 21/02/2023- The RFP template has been given to the client, while we've found out that companies we're competing with are Humantics AI and FairSale. The client remains non-committal to using our template - the awaited RFP document is still in the pipeline. 28/02/2023- The prioritization of internal matters within the stakeholder team has resulted in a delay of the project and the RFP document for a couple of weeks. 07/03/2023- The RFP document, which seems to adopt the customer's personal template, has been made available. Yet, its resemblance to many aspects of our own template is quite noticeable, leading me to suspect that components from what I previously sent were fused into it. For your information, the deadline for our RFP response is set for two weeks from today, precisely on the 21st of March 2023. 14/03/2023- We have yet to complete RFP documentation as we are waiting on feedback from Product Marketing about our road map and related information. We are also awaiting completion of the DPA section of the RFP by our data privacy specialists. 20/03/2023- Finished compiling our RFP response and sent it in today, with an annual license fee of $350K and $200K for implementation. 25/03/2023- Invitations have been dispatched by the client for a planned session that includes a Q and A about our feedback – all important stakeholders from BA should be present. 27/03/2023- Our question and answer session was remarkably successful, as we addressed all of their points. I also proposed a specialized Post RFP workshop where we would take them through a demo configured for their unique use cases. 28/03/2023- The customer requested that we organize the workshop on the 14th of April. We're teaming up with the solution consulting department internally to get the demo environment ready. 30/03/2023- Geoff Gables, Sales VP and my primary champion, indicated they're in the process of internally securing budget, which seems to be in a few stages of approval with the final segment due on 21st April 2023. He didn't disclose a specific figure when I inquired about the level of budget they were targeting, but conveyed it would be enough to meet solution needs. 14/04/2023-  A four-hour demo session turned out to be very effective with all stakeholders in attendance, including Economic Buyer Jim Jackson, the Head of Operations. We managed to cover their main concerns, with a few queries arising about service delivery and SOW. To build out the SOW is our next move. I offered to set up a Value Engineering session to generate a Proof of Value document, to which they consented. We consented to launch the Value Engineering Session on April 21st. 21/04/2023- Our value engineering call is complete and we'll make sure they have the POV document by the close of week. 27/04/2023 - Delivered a standpoint on value engineering. 28/04/2023- Kick-started the work on the SOW internally, with plans to present the final implementation program by the 5th of May, 2023. 05/05/2023- Handed over the SOW to the client with total services costing 195K. 07/05/2023- An in-depth discussion planned for the SOW call with the customer about the project timeline and plan. 10/05/2023- Got into contact with my Champion Geoff Gables and questioned when the VOC is scheduled to be declared - he declared it would be by next week's end.  17/05/2023- VOC recognition has been bestowed upon us, and we've moved forward to discussions involving Procurement. We're slated to have our primary call with them in the week ahead. 25/05/2023- Procurement recommended during our call to consider slashing our prices across the entire range if we want to make progress. 26/05/2023- An understanding was reached with the internal management to provide a further 5% discount on the RFP price that was previously decreased by 20%. However, this offer stands only if the transaction concludes by the end of June. 27/05/2023- To close all outstanding items, the EC, the champion, and I met today to talk about constructing a Mutual Activity Plan. 27/05/2023- Dispatch the Order form along with the MSA to the client today, enabling their legal team to process the terms. 29/05/2023- The congregation with the Legal team and our attorneys has been programmed for 7/06/2023. 30/05/2023- During my discussion with the EB, he proposed a termination for convenience clause. I reminded him of our revenue recognition requirements and suggested a termination for cause clause instead. 07/06/2023- Our initial legal discussion about their contract points went well, with some outstanding queries about Termination for convenience and Support terms still to be discussed. 09/06/2023- We responded to the clients' redlines and handed back the contract. 10/06/2023- Today, the MAP has been fabricated by me, and the client was sent a template for reviewing. 15/06/2023- Today, Legal announced their contentment with the MSA and their intention to give it to procurement for furthering the signature procedure. 20/06/2023- Today, it came to my knowledge that the person who signs is on leave until 4th July. I restated that our price is secured until the end of June and another signatory is necessary. 26/06/2023- Identified Ian Harper, the COO, as the back-up signatory and prepared the contract for his signature. 30/06/2023- Today, a contract was signed, an order form is expected tomorrow but the date will still reflect 30th June - our Sales Operations team are tweaking a few minor terms that were brought up at the ultimate moment. 01/07/2023- A secured deal, as the order form has been signed and the purchase order has been accepted.``` identify the pain points faced by Account in its current workflows."}, {"role": "assistant","content":"Efficiency in the sales procedure can only be achieved through simplification since it's overly complicated.

They cited the sales process to be overly complex and they highlighted the need to simplify it, as well as to augment the average deal size. They intend to fortify their customer care for existing clients by elevating customer success rates and protecting their renewal rates. For generating early stage leads, they use Salesforce and Gong.io together with Outreach. Accepted to go forward with a demo of the solution. An excessive number of incongruous sales systems is what they are dealing with. We aspire to deliver a seamless, unified platform experience that will allow users to manage most tasks within one application. 17/12/2022- Forwarded the NDA for authentication. 20/12/2022- I'm still in anticipation of the returned NDA. In addition, I have sent an email to Jim Jackson, the operation's head, to introduce myself along with Dealstream in the hope of enlisting his participation in our future demo session. 23/12/2022- Took the initiative to email stakeholders, promoting the NDA and suggesting possible schedule slots for the demonstration.  01/01/2023- With 7th January 2023 confirmed as the desired date for the demonstration after the returning of NDA, Ken was emailed and asked to identify and inform us about the attendees. 07/01/2023- The session for the demonstration was impressive. They signaled that they were impressed by the UI/ UX, yet stipulated that they need to ensure the compatibility with their comprehensive tech stack including Gong. There is a need to orchestrate a communication with their team and ours specifically from product management, to let them know this integration job can be completed. In addition, there was some concern around data privacy which they need their Data Privacy team to look into. I've asked them to send over their DPA, and with luck, it should arrive by the end of the week. 14/01/2023- Discussed Details: Conducted a thorough needs analysis for Account, while zeroing in on specific problems they grapple with. Explored how an effective solution could be the deployment of a cutting-edge AI software. 21/01/2023- Arranged a gathering to talk through the data security and privacy matters related to our AI software solution. We also examined the solution's conformity to Account' data protection laws. 22/01/2023- Arranged a product demonstration to highlight the major features of our AI software solution. Showcased how it could be fused with the existing systems at Account to advance their operations. 30/01/2023- Answered all questions and uncertainties that popped up following the product demonstration.

Carried out discussions on different pricing possibilities and projected initiation schedules. 14/02/2023- As per the customer’s comment, they are leaning towards sending out RFPs to approximately five solutions. The RFP should be out anytime within the next three weeks, not exceeding 28th Feb 2023. I am in collaboration with our RFP team internally to deliver a well-crafted RFP template for the client. 21/02/2023- Given our competitors are Humantics AI and FairSale, the client was sent the RFP template. While we still wait for the commitment from the client to use our template, the RFP document is also yet to be received. 28/02/2023- Owing to the internal priorities of the stakeholder team, there's a delay in the RFP document and a two-week pause in the project. 07/03/2023- An RFP document has just been unveiled, and it seems to have been created from the customer's own template. Despite this, I'm seeing quite a few similarities with our own model, suggesting that they might have used some sections from the information I passed on. It's also important to note that we have to submit our response to the RFP proposal by the 21st of March 2023, exactly two weeks from today. 14/03/2023- Feedback from Product Marketing concerning our road map is still pending, therefore the completion of RFP documentation is on hold. The RFP's DPA section is also awaiting completion by our data privacy team. 20/03/2023- Earlier today, we submitted our RFP response which included annual licenses expenses of 350K USD and implementation costs at 200K. 25/03/2023- A discussion session is established, and invitations have been sent out by the client concerning a Q and A on our response - the presence of all major stakeholders on the BA side is necessary. 27/03/2023- The Q and A session was a resounding success, as we managed to address all their points exhaustively. I suggested offering a personalized Post RFP workshop to help them understand a configured demo representative of all of their use cases. 28/03/2023- We've been tasked by the customer to facilitate a workshop on the 14th of April, and our solution consulting team is working industriously to configure the demo environment internally. 30/03/2023- My main champion, Geoff Gables, who is the VP of Sales, has disclosed they are currently in the process of securing their internal budget. With several rounds of approval, their final sign-off meeting is planned for 21st April 2023. Although he didn't disclose the exact number, he maintained they are looking for a sufficient budget to fulfill the solution's requirements. 14/04/2023- The demo session was a triumph, spanning over 4 hours. All stakeholders were present, including Economic Buyer Jim Jackson, the Head of Operations. We reviewed all the critical points, with a few service delivery and SOW-related queries coming up. The building out of the SOW is the next step. I proposed holding a Value Engineering session to create a Proof of Value document. They concurred, and it was mutually decided to initiate the session on April 21st. 21/04/2023- The value engineering call was a success and we aim to deliver the POV document to them by the close of week. 27/04/2023 - Shared an outlook on value engineering. 28/04/2023- Set the wheels in motion for the internal SOW project, proposing to deliver the SOW and its final implementation program no later than May 5th, 2023. 05/05/2023- Submitted the SOW to the client with a total service cost of 195K. 07/05/2023- Discussing the project timeline and plan in more detail in a SOW call with the customer. 10/05/2023- I contacted Geoff Gables, our Champion, to find out our timeframe for the VOC news - he answered it will be by the culmination of next week.  17/05/2023- Following our recent VOC award, we've ventured into negotiations with Procurement. The first of these discussions will be held during next week's call. 25/05/2023- During our call, the procurement team mentioned the necessity for a comprehensive price reduction to move forward. 26/05/2023- The internal management and I have resolved to extend a 5% discount on the RFP price, which was already lowered by 20%. This extra concession is subject to a closing of the deal by the end of June. 27/05/2023- We had a productive discussion with the EC and the champion today about creating a Mutual Activity Plan to tackle all outstanding issues. 27/05/2023- The client has to receive the Order form and MSA today to allow their legal team the chance to process the terms. 29/05/2023- Our Law team and the Legal team are scheduled to have a discussion on 7/06/2023. 30/05/2023- In my discussion with the EB, he wanted to insert a termination for convenience provision. I mentioned this was not feasible due to our revenue recognition conditions and agreed to include a termination for cause clause. 07/06/2023- The original legal conversation on their positions towards contract was fruitful, but there are still some unsettled points on Termination for convenience and Support terms. 09/06/2023- We took care of the clients' redlines and returned the contract. 10/06/2023- The client was provided with a template today, which I assembled along with the MAP for their inspection. 15/06/2023- The Legal department authenticated today that they agree with the MSA and will pass it on to procurement to move forward with the signing sequence. 20/06/2023- Today, I found out that the signatory will be unavailable until July 4th. I underscored that our pricing maintains until the closing of June, and we ought to find a stand-in signatory. 26/06/2023- We have identified COO Ian Harper as the back-up signatory, and the contract is currently awaiting his signature. 30/06/2023- The contract was successfully signed today while the order form, even though expected tomorrow, will be dated as June 30th - some slight changes are being made by our Sales Ops due to last minute concerns on the order form. 01/07/2023- The order form has been signed off on; the purchase order has been received - Deal sealed.``` identify the pain points faced by Account in its current workflows."}, {"role": "assistant","content":"The need for streamlining arises from the extremely complex sales process.

It was indicated by them that the sales process was too complicated and needs to be made more efficient, and an increase in average deal size should also be considered. Their objective is to boost service quality for their existing clients by escalating the customer success rates, consequently guarding their renewal rates. They resort to Salesforce, Gong.io and Outreach for the early stages of their lead generation. Approved of moving ahead with a demonstration of the resolution.

We then emailed Ken requesting identification and communication of the session's attendees. 07/01/2023- The demonstration was carried out well in the session. Their fondness for our UI/UX was clear, but they insisted on ensuring the seamless integration with their existing tech stack, with a special mention of Gong. Before starting the integration work, it could be beneficial to hold a discussion with their team and our product management team to alleviate any potential doubts. In addition, there was some concern around data privacy which they need their Data Privacy team to look into. They've been requested to email us their DPA which we're hoping to receive by the week's end. 14/01/2023- Key Discussion Points: Held a detailed needs confrontation with Account, focusing specifically on the pain points and difficulties they face.

My task is to work closely with our internal RFP team to provide an adequate RFP template for the client. 21/02/2023- Dispatched our RFP template to the client, and amidst competition from Humantics AI and FairSale. The client, however, has yet to commit to our template, and we are still waiting for their RFP document. 28/02/2023- Both the RFP document and the project have been delayed for two weeks because of the stakeholder team's internal priorities. 07/03/2023- With the release of the RFP document, I've observed that it's largely grounded on the customer's personal template, but it also bears a lot of resemblances to ours. It's probable they embedded some elements from the content I gave them. Also, the targeted date for the final RFP response is two weeks from now, 21st March 2023. 14/03/2023- Our RFP documentation process is incomplete as we are waiting on our Product Marketing team for feedback regarding our roadmap and customer release information. Similarly, the DPA section is pending completion from our data privacy experts. 20/03/2023- Today, we submitted our RFP response, pricing the licenses at a yearly 350K USD and implementation at 200k. 25/03/2023-  A client-organized session, including a Q and A dealing with our feedback, is scheduled, and invites have been sent – all the key figures on the BA side should participate. 27/03/2023- The Q and A session was conducted smoothly and we were able to answer all their inquiries. I proposed hosting a made-to-order Post RFP workshop to guide them through a demo configured for all their use situations. 28/03/2023- The customer has specified that we hold the workshop on the 14th of April. We're joining forces with the solution consulting team internally to fine-tune the demo environment. 30/03/2023- Speaking with Geoff Gables, my primary champion and the VP of Sales, he explained that they are currently working on securing their budget. This involves a number of approval stages and final approval is expected on the 21st April 2023. He was unsure of the exact figure but assured me it would cover the solution's needs. 14/04/2023- The 4-hour demo session progressed smoothly with all stakeholders, including Economic Buyer Jim Jackson, the Head of Operations actively participating. All their main issues were addressed, along with a few questions on service delivery and SOW. The subsequent step is to develop the SOW. I suggested conducting a Value Engineering session to devise a Proof of Value document.They consented and we slated it for 21st April. 21/04/2023- We’ve accomplished our value engineering call and are planning to have the Pоoint of View (POV) document with them by week end. 27/04/2023 - Offered a perspective on value engineering. 28/04/2023- Embarked on the internal development of the SOW, aiming to conclude it along with the final implementation program by the due date of 5th May 2023. 05/05/2023- The SOW, consisting of services worth 195K, was handed over to the client. 07/05/2023- In a SOW call, conversation with a customer on the subject of a more detailed project plan and timeline. 10/05/2023- Reached out to Geoff Gables, who is my Champion, to question him regarding the VOC revelation's scheduled date - he confirmed it as by the conclusion of the following week. 17/05/2023- New discussion with Procurement has been triggered by our VOC award.

This added reduction is specifically tied to a transaction closure by June. 27/05/2023- Both the EC and the champion sat down with me today to brainstorm a Mutual Activity Plan that would allow us to complete all outstanding assignments. 27/05/2023- Forward the MSA and Order form to the client today for the procedure involving their legal team to take effect. 29/05/2023- On 7/06/2023, there's a scheduled meeting with our legal department and the Legal team. 30/05/2023- The EB signaled the need for a termination for convenience clause during our discussion, but I made it clear that this was impracticable due to our revenue recognition standards and agreed to a termination for cause clause instead. 07/06/2023- Our maiden legal call to deliberate on their perspectives on the contract was constructive, yet there are a few outstanding subjects concerning Termination for convenience and Support terms. 09/06/2023-  After addressing the clients' redlines, we were able to return the contract. 10/06/2023- After creating the MAP, I sent the template to the client today for them to look over. 15/06/2023- Legal expressed today their approval of the MSA and will convey it to procurement to expedite the signature process. 20/06/2023- I was made aware today that the person authorized to sign is vacationing until 4th July. I reinstate that our pricing stays intact until June ends, and we must locate a spare signatory. 26/06/2023- Ian Harper, holding the position of COO, has been identified as the back-up signatory and the contract to be signed is with him. 30/06/2023- Our agreement got signed today, with the order form to be received tomorrow but dated for June 30th - some last minute minor shifts by our Sales Operations team have been brought to light.  01/07/2023- With a signed order form and a received purchase order, the deal is completed.``` identify the pain points faced by Account in its current workflows."}, {"role": "assistant","content":"The overly complicated nature of our sales process underscores the need for streamlining.

They put forth the view that the sales process in place is more complicated than it needs to be and needs streamlining, in addition to an expansion in the average deal size. Their ambition is to provide better service to their existing clients by increasing their success rates, thereby preserving their renewal rates. Their process of early stage lead generation relies on Salesforce, Gong.io, and Outreach. Settled on proceeding with a demonstration for the solution. They are juggling too many unrelated sales systems. Our aim is to create a comprehensive platform experience, enabling the user to undertake most tasks in a singular application. 17/12/2022- Relayed the NDA for certification. 20/12/2022- The NDA hasn't been returned yet and I'm still waiting. Also, I've contacted Jim Jackson, the operations head, via email to introduce myself and Dealstream and explore the possibility of his involvement in our scheduled demo session.  23/12/2022- Communicated via email with stakeholders to expedite the NDA procedure and suggest feasible dates for the demonstration. 01/01/2023- Following the return of the NDA, the 7th January 2023 has been agreed upon as the best date for the demonstration. Furthermore, Ken has been contacted via email to identify and inform us about the expected attendees. 07/01/2023- The demo session proceeded without any hiccups. They expressed their preference for our UI/UX, but the condition was that it would need to integrate seamlessly with their broad tech stack including Gong. Need to establish a networking session with their and our product team to guarantee them that the integration task can be executed. In addition, there was some concern around data privacy which they need their Data Privacy team to look into. I've asked them to share their DPA with us, and they will likely do so by the conclusion of the week. 14/01/2023- Dialogue Summary: Implemented a complete needs analysis involving Account, highlighting and discussing particular issues they have to deal with. Looked into how effective AI software solutions could potentially resolve these challenges. 21/01/2023- Facilitated a session to discuss data safety and privacy implications of the AI software solution in question. We also reviewed its alignment with Account' requisite data protection measures. 22/01/2023- Presented a product demo, pinpointing the chief features and power of our AI software solution. Showed its capability to be merged with Account ' current system, potentially uplifting their operations efficiency. 30/01/2023- Clarified doubts and issues that occurred after the product presentation. Elucidated about the technical details, integration processes and the probable ROI that'll benefit Account. 07/02/2023- Delivered a specialized proposal which observed in detail the AI software solution, its profits, and its harmony to Account' needs. Also, had a dialogue concerning the pricing possibilities and estimated initiation schedules. 14/02/2023- It was stated by the customer that they are inclined to go for RFP with nearly five solutions. The RFP is set to be released no later than the next three weeks or by 28th Feb 2023 to be specific. I am liaising with the internal team in charge of RFP to avail the client with an RFP template to suit their needs. 21/02/2023- We've sent out the RFP template to our client, whilst finding out our competitive field includes Humantics AI and FairSale. The client is yet to decide on using our template, and we're still in the waiting for their RFP document. 28/02/2023- It's the internal priorities of the stakeholder team that have caused a two-week delay in both the project and the RFP document. 07/03/2023- The RFP document that was recently circulated appears to be based mostly on the customer's original template. Yet, it noticeably shares a vast proportion of comparable points with ours, which leads me to believe that they utilized some of the particulars I forwarded to them. Also, the deposition of the RFP response is due in two weeks, dated 21st March 2023. 14/03/2023- The RFP documentation process is not yet completed —we are currently waiting for our Product Marketing team to provide their feedback on our roadmap and the data that can be disclosed to the customer. Our data privacy team is also yet to finish up on the DPA section of the RFP. 20/03/2023- The RFP response that we submitted this morning outlines an annual charge of 350K USD for licenses and 200K for implementation. 25/03/2023- A rendezvous has been scheduled and invites have been sent by the client regarding a Q and A session about our response - all responsible parties from the BA side are required to attend. 27/03/2023- The Q & A session was executed perfectly; we addressed all their issues and I proposed that we instigate a specific Post RFP workshop to exhibit a corresponding demo catering to all of their use cases. 28/03/2023- As requested by the client, the workshop will proceed on the 14th of April. Simultaneously, we're coordinating with our solution consulting team to get the demo environment ready.  30/03/2023- In my recent discussion with my main champion, Geoff Gables who is the VP Sales, he revealed that budget securing process is ongoing. They're undertaking a few rounds of approval which will culminate on 21st April 2023. He was not able to provide a specific number for the budget they are trying to secure but assured it would be enough to cater to the solution requirements. 14/04/2023-  A successful demo session lasted for 4 hours with all key stakeholders including Economic Buyer, Jim Jackson and the Head of Operations gracing the event. We managed to cover all their principal concerns, with a few queries around service delivery and SOW popping up. The next phase involves building out the SOW. I put forth a suggestion to hold a Value Engineering session to design a Proof of Value document, which they agreed to. The session is set to kick off on 21st April. 21/04/2023- Having completed the value engineering call, we commit to having the POV document with them before the conclusion of week. 27/04/2023 - Language about value engineering has been provided. 28/04/2023- We've begun in-house work on the SOW, with a timeline to deliver the completed SOW and its implementation program by 5th May 2023. 05/05/2023- Provided the client with the SOW, totalling services to 195K. 07/05/2023- Customer planned for SOW call to discuss project plan specifics and detailing the timeline. 10/05/2023- During our conversation, Geoff Gables, the Champion, told me that the VOC announcement is planned for the end of next week. 17/05/2023-  With the VOC award under our belt, we've launched into discussion talks with Procurement. We're anticipating our first call with them to take place next week. 25/05/2023- We've spoken to procurement, who suggested that for us to progress, there needs to be a universal price cut. 26/05/2023- I've interacted with the internal team and a consensus was reached to offer an added 5% discount. This is over and above the 20% reduction we've made before on our RFP price, with a clause of deal closure by end of June attached. 27/05/2023- Together with the EC and the champion, we pondered over constructing a Mutual Activity Plan today, aiming to resolve all outstanding items. 27/05/2023- Have the client's legal team process the terms by sending them the MSA and Order form today. 29/05/2023- The date for the meeting with the external Legal team and our in-house law team is 7/06/2023. 30/05/2023- An interesting conversation with the EB brought up the need for a termination clause for convenience. I highlighted our revenue recognition requirements which rendered this impossible and gave assurance that a termination for cause clause will be instated instead. 07/06/2023- The primary legal dialogue to address their stances on the contract was effective, although we still retain some contentious points around Termination for convenience and Support terms. 09/06/2023- We managed the clients' redlines and sent the contract back. 10/06/2023- Having constructed the MAP, the template was forwarded to the client today for their review. 15/06/2023- Satisfied with the MSA, Legal today will send it over to procurement to facilitate the endorsement process. 20/06/2023- Today's discovery indicated that the individual who will sign is on break until the 4th of July. I repeated that our prices are stable until the end of June, and we need to pinpoint a back up signatory. 26/06/2023- Ian Harper, COO, has been assigned as the back-up signatory and is currently in possession of the contract to sign. 30/06/2023- Today marked the signing of the contract with the order form on its way tomorrow, despite its June 30th dating - there are a few minor alterations on the order form from our Sales Ops team due to unforeseen last-minute issues. 01/07/2023- Deal concluded successfully - thanks to the receipt of the purchase order and the signed order form.``` identify the pain points faced by Account in its current workflows."}, {"role": "assistant","content":"A highly complex sales process like ours necessitates immediate streamlining.

They communicated that the sales process is overly detailed and recommended an effort to streamline this, along with increasing the average deal size. They plan to enhance their provision for existing clients by maximizing the customer success rates, which should help safe-guard their renewal rates. The initial phase of their lead generation employs Salesforce, Gong.io, as well as Outreach. Decided to proceed with a solution demonstration. Their operations are disrupted by a surfeit of disjointed sales systems. We aspire to introduce a unified front on our platform, where users can accomplish most of their tasks. 17/12/2022- Dispatched the Non-Disclosure Agreement for signature. 20/12/2022-  I am still waiting on the NDA to be returned. Furthermore, I've initiated conversation via email with Jim Jackson, the head of operations, in order to introduce myself and Dealstream, as well as to possibly incorporate him in the planned demo session. 23/12/2022-  Emailed the stakeholders to accelerate the NDA process, while proposing suitable dates and times for the demonstration. 01/01/2023- After receiving the returned NDA, we were in agreement that the best date for the demonstration would be 7th January 2023. Ken was then contacted through email to get the names of the attendees and pass that information to us. 07/01/2023- The demo session was effective and productive. They affirmed their liking for the UI/UX, yet, held that assurance was required for the integration with their extensive tech suite, including Gong. It is vital to have a dialogue with their team along with our product management to ensure them of the viability of this integration process. In addition, there was some concern around data privacy which they need their Data Privacy team to look into. I've directed them to provide their DPA to us; we should hopefully receive it by the end of this week. 14/01/2023- Session highlights: Undertook a comprehensive needs study engaging Account, reviewing specific hardships they endure. Explored the potential of AI software solutions in effectively mitigating these obstacles. 21/01/2023- Hosted a dialogue to review data privacy and security concerns pertaining to the AI software solution.

I am working together with our internal RFP team to create a suitable RFP template to hand over to the client.  21/02/2023- After submitting our RFP template to the client, we discovered they are also considering Humantics AI and FairSale. So far the client has not decided to use our template, and we are still awaiting their RFP document. 28/02/2023- The project and the RFP document are on hold for a couple of weeks due to the internal focus of the stakeholder team. 07/03/2023- The customer’s revised RFP document has been distributed. I can't help but notice that, although it primarily uses their template, there are several similarities with our own. It's possible that they incorporated some of the materials I sent earlier. An important thing to remember is that our response to the RFP is expected by the 21st of March 2023, that is, two weeks from now. 14/03/2023- The RFP documentation is not done yet, owing to the feedback we're expecting from Product Marketing on our strategy and customer-committed elements. The DPA section of the RFP is also awaiting completion by our data privacy department. 20/03/2023- This morning, we submitted an RFP response, placing the annual cost for licenses at $350K and implementation at 200K. 25/03/2023- An interactive session has been planned by the client who has also sent out invites to a Q and A discussion regarding our actions - all BA side stakeholders are urged to participate.  27/03/2023- The Q and A session was excellent, we managed to answer all of their queries. I proposed that we set up a customized Post RFP workshop to show them a tailored demo that covers all of their use cases. 28/03/2023- Our client has requested us to hold the workshop on the 14th April. Collaboratively, we're working with our solution consulting team internally to set up a demo environment. 30/03/2023- During a conversation with Geoff Gables, the VP Sales and a critical resource, he mentioned they're currently in the throes of securing their internal budget. There are a few stages of approval, with the last one scheduled for 21st April 2023. Although unable to give an exact figure, he said they're aiming for a budget large enough to cover all aspects of the needed solution. 14/04/2023- The demo session went splendidly, it spanned over 4 hours, and all key stakeholders were present, including Economic Buyer, Jim Jackson, and the Head of Operations. We covered all their main topics, and a few inquiries arose related to service delivery and SOW. The next crucial move is to establish the SOW. I suggested going in for a Value Engineering session for the creation of a Proof of Value document, and they agreed. We decided to begin this session on April 21st. 21/04/2023- Successfully wrapped up the value engineering call, and we are aiming to have the POV document with them by the week's end. 27/04/2023 - Supplied a viewpoint on the topic of value engineering. 28/04/2023- Made a start on the internal handling of the SOW, setting the goal to finish off with the final implementation program by the 5th May 2023. 05/05/2023- With total services amounting to 195K, the SOW was delivered to the client. 07/05/2023- Planned SOW call, targeting a detailed conversation with the customer about the project plan and timeline. 10/05/2023- Geoff Gables, the Champion I'm working with, informed me upon asking that the VOC disclosure should be by next week's end. 17/05/2023- We've recently been granted the VOC award and have started conversations with Procurement as a result. Our initial consultation with them is expected to happen the following week. 25/05/2023- Upon chatting with the procurement team, it's clear that we'll need a widespread reduction in price to continue moving forward. 26/05/2023-  Upon deliberation with internal management, we've agreed to proffer a 5% discount to the already 20% discounted RFP price, provided the deal is finalized by June end. 27/05/2023- A meeting was held today with the EC and the champion to discuss the formation of a Mutual Activity Plan, which will guide us in completing all remaining tasks. 27/05/2023- To expedite processing of the terms by their legal team, the MSA and Order form need to be sent to the client today. 29/05/2023- Both the Legal team and our legal unit are booked for a meeting on 7/06/2023. 30/05/2023- The EB suggested a termination for convenience clause in our conversation, to which I responded that our revenue recognition obligations wouldn't permit it, but a termination for cause would definitely be included. 07/06/2023- The initial court-ordained discussion about their perspectives on the contract went smoothly, but we still have some unresolved issues about Termination for convenience and Support terms to sort out. 09/06/2023- Addressing the clients' redlines, we then returned the contract. 10/06/2023- Currently, the MAP was built by me, followed by the template being sent to the client for consideration. 15/06/2023- Today, Legal team endorsed the MSA and will dispatch it to procurement to instigate the signing process. 20/06/2023- I stumbled upon the information today that our authorised signatory is on a holiday until July 4th. I reinstated that our price hold is active until the 30th of June, and the search for a supplementary signatory is crucial. 26/06/2023- COO Ian Harper has been identified as the back-up signatory and the contract is now in for his approval. 30/06/2023- We finalized the contract today and anticipate the order form by tomorrow, but it will be marked as 30th June - our Sales Ops team is making some small changes due to last-minute concerns on the order form. 01/07/2023- Deal finalized - marked by the purchase order's receipt and the signing of the order form.``` identify the pain points faced by Account in its current workflows."}, {"role": "assistant","content":"Our sales process is overly intricate, hence there is a pressing need for it to be streamlined.

They expressed that the intricacy of the sales process is problematic and needs to be simplified, plus there's a need to enhance the average deal size. By raising their customer success rates, they are looking to significantly improve services provided to their existing clients and ensure their renewal rates remain steady. Salesforce along with Gong.io and Outreach, is utilized for early stage lead generation in their process. Reached an agreement to move forward with a solution presentation. They are contending with an overwhelming number of disconnected sales systems.

They voiced their love for the UI/UX design, however, they put forth a condition to guarantee the integration with their entire tech stack, including Gong. It's important that we arrange a conversation with their team and our product management team to provide the assurance that this integration task can be successfully completed. In addition, there was some concern around data privacy which they need their Data Privacy team to look into. I have asked for their DPA to be sent over to us, which they are expected to do by the end of this week. 14/01/2023- Main Talking Points: Carried out an extensive study of the needs of Account, looking specifically at their unique difficulties.

The proposal also involved a discussion about various pricing strategies and potential timelines for its implementation. 14/02/2023- The customer has conveyed they will likely submit RFPs to close to five solutions, with the intention of releasing the RFP no later than the upcoming three weeks, specifically by 28th Feb 2023. I am in collaboration with our RFP team to come up with an efficient RFP template for the client's convenience. 21/02/2023-  Upon sending the RFP template to the client, we came to know that Humantics AI and FairSale are also in the fray. We're yet to receive client's confirmation on using our template, and the RFP document is still awaited. 28/02/2023- Internal priorities within the stakeholder team have resulted in a delay of the RFP document and a couple of weeks' hold-up in the project progress. 07/03/2023- We have the released RFP document, which is heavily influenced by the customer's own template. It's noteworthy to mention that a lot of the points parallel ours. This leads me to assume that they have used some concepts from the information I transmitted to them. And to keep it on your radar, the deadline to provide our response to this RFP is the 21st of March 2023, marking two weeks from now. 14/03/2023- Completing RFP documentation - still awaiting feedback from Product Marketing on our roadmap and what can be released to the customer as part of the response. Also awaiting the DPA section of the RFP to be completed by our data privacy team. 20/03/2023- This morning our team submitted the RFP response, with the licensing costs set to 350K USD annually, and another 200K USD for the implementation. 25/03/2023- The client has set up a dialogue session and sent out invites for a Q and A on our response - it is vital that all key BA side stakeholders attend. 27/03/2023- The Q and A session unfolded exceptionally well as we addressed all the queries successfully. I further suggested a custom-made Post RFP workshop to familiarize them with a configured demo that takes into account all their use cases. 28/03/2023- At our customer's behest, we're conducting a workshop on the 14th of April. Infrastructure for the demo environment is being set up by our in-house solution consulting team. 30/03/2023- I had a discussion with Geoff Gables, my main contact and the VP of Sales, who mentioned they are in the process of securing their internal budget. This involves several rounds of approval and the final decision is due on 21st April 2023. Although they couldn't specify an exact budget figure, they assured it would cover the solution's requirements. 14/04/2023- Our demo session was highly successful. It lasted for a substantial 4 hours, during which all stakeholders, including Economic Buyer, Jim Jackson, and the Head of Operations, participated actively. We discussed all the major points they had on their agenda, including addressing questions on service delivery and SOW. To construct the SOW is the next step planned. I also proposed holding a Value Engineering Session to formulate a Proof of Value document, which they agreed to. We have mutually decided to initiate this session on April 21st. 21/04/2023- Our team has completed the value engineering call, with plans to deliver the POV document to them by the end of the week. 27/04/2023 - Provided a point of view regarding value engineering. 28/04/2023- Got down to working on the SOW internally, with the aim to finalize and deliver the SOW including its implementation program on or before 5th May 2023. 05/05/2023- The SOW, containing services valued at 195K, has been delivered to the client. 07/05/2023- To delve deeper into the timeline and project plan, a SOW call is scheduled with the customer. 10/05/2023- Upon asking for the VOC announcement's anticipated date, Geoff Gables, my Champion, confirmed it would be ready by next week's close. 17/05/2023- We are excited to announce that post our VOC award, we've initiated discussions with Procurement, with the first interaction slated for the upcoming week. 25/05/2023- Having communicated with the procurement team, they emphasized that a total price cut is essential to proceed. 26/05/2023- Post communication with the internal management, we decided to grant an extra discount of 5% despite the RFP price already being lowered by 20%.

The inaugural contact with Procurement will take place in the coming week. 25/05/2023- We just had a discussion with procurement and they informed us that price reduction across all areas is necessary for any advancement. 26/05/2023- After conferring with our internal management, we've decided to grant an extra 5% discount on the already 20%-reduced RFP price, but on the condition that the deal closes by the end of June. 27/05/2023- Constructing a Mutual Activity Plan was the main topic discussed in the meeting with the EC and the champion today, that is intended to help us resolve all outstanding items. 27/05/2023- The MSA and Order form should be sent to the client today for their legal team's processing of the terms. 29/05/2023- Both our legal team and the additional Legal team are planned to meet on 7/06/2023. 30/05/2023- When the EB and I spoke, he insisted on a termination clause for convenience.

The NDA was sent out early for signature. Sent an email to stakeholders lobbying for an NDA. Jim Jackson, head of operations, was the recipient of my introductory email regarding myself and Dealstream, suggesting the possibility of his inclusion in the upcoming demo session. Reached out to Champion via email to clarify the stakeholder attendee for the demonstration. Arrange a call for the client and our product management team to discuss integration requirements. Asked for the client's Data Privacy Agreement (DPA) to be sent to us. Undertook a complete analysis of needs to grasp the problems and challenges experienced by the client. A meeting was held to address Data Privacy concerns in the early phases of the deal cycle. Organize a demo that clearly shows the integration possibilities of the solution into their existing systems. Immediately post-demo, we handled the client's inquiries and worries. Explained the technical and integration requirements and the associated ROI for the BA. Showcased a bespoke proposal illustrating the AI software solution and its intrinsic benefits, specifically oriented towards the needs of Account. Discussed the potential pricing structures and implementation timeframes. The RFP template was sent to the client. Came to know that Humantics AI and FairSale are part of the competition. Endorsed the idea of holding a detailed post-RFP workshop to guide them through a personalized demo, accommodating all their use cases. Cooperating with the solution consulting team inside the company to set up the demo environment. Suggested hosting a value engineering session to compile a Proof of Value document. Contacted Geoff Gables, known as my Champion, and questioned the scheduled date for unveiling the VOC. We have come to an agreement with our internal management to propose an additional 5% discount, given the fact that our RFP price was slashed by 20% from list. This further markdown is subject to an end of June closing date. Today, I engaged with both the EC and the champion on constructing a Mutual Activity Plan. This aims to guide all of us in finalizing any remaining tasks needed for closure. For the client to process the terms through their legal team, send out the MSA and Order form today. Given our revenue recognition requirements, we had to deny the request for termination for convenience, however, termination for cause is encompassed. Developed the Mutual Activity Plan (MAP) and delivered the template to the client for assessment. Re stressed on our price maintaining the same until the conclusion of June and we need a substitute signatory in times of their absence."}]}

They pointed out that the sales operation is excessively detailed, needing streamlining, and an increase in the average deal size is also necessary. They aim to strengthen their services for existing clients by improving their customer success rates, which would also help maintain their renewal rates. Their early stage lead generation involves the use of Salesforce, Gong.io, and Outreach. Concurred to advance with showing a solution demo. They suffer from having too many unconnected sales systems. Our goal is to provide a smooth and combined platform experience where the user can accomplish much of the work in one program. 17/12/2022- Delivered the NDA for endorsement. 20/12/2022- I've yet to get a returned NDA. Moreover, I emailed Jim Jackson, the chief of operations, to present myself and Dealstream, contemplating his possible participation in our planned demo session. 23/12/2022- Reached out to stakeholders via email to lobby for the NDA and to propose optimal dates/times for the demonstration. 01/01/2023- Ken was tasked, through an email, with identifying and informing us about the attendees for the demonstration session, scheduled for the 7th January 2023 following the return of the NDA. 07/01/2023- The demo session was successful. They communicated their admiration for the UI/UX, but also emphasized the importance of a successful integration with their entire tech stack, particularly Gong. We must set a meeting with their team and our product management department to reassure them that we're capable of carrying out this integration task. In addition, there was some concern around data privacy which they need their Data Privacy team to look into. I have implored them to dispatch their DPA to us, ideally before the end of the week. 14/01/2023- Points of Discussion: Conducted a broad-based needs evaluation with Account. Discussed in detail the particular issues and struggles they deal with. Examined how an AI software solution could potentially solve these issues. 21/01/2023- Organized a discussion forum to go over issues concerning data privacy and security of the AI software solution. We also clarified how the solution fulfills Account' data safety protocols. 22/01/2023- Organized a product demonstration to showcase the distinguishing features of our AI software solution. Explained its possible integration within Account' existing systems to optimize their workflows and operations. 30/01/2023- Responded to questions and resolved issues that appeared following the product demo. Provided clarity on technical dimensions, integration demands, and prospective ROI available for Account. 07/02/2023- Provided a bespoke proposal explaining the relevance of the AI software solution, how beneficial it is, and how it matches Account' needs. Pricing options and likely implementation timelines were also discussed. 14/02/2023-  It was suggested by the customer they are planning to submit RFPs to around five solutions. It’s expected to be released over the coming three weeks, but not later than 28th Feb 2023. I'm teaming up with our in-house RFP department to create an RFP template for the client. 21/02/2023- Found out that Humantics AI and FairSale are our competitors after sending the client our RFP template. We haven't heard from them regarding their commitment to our template and we're waiting for them to return the RFP document. 28/02/2023- The project, as well as the RFP document, has been put on hold for a couple of weeks due to the internal priorities of the stakeholder team. 07/03/2023-  I've noticed that the released RFP document, even though based on the customer's own template, shares a number of similarities with ours. They may have included some aspects from the material I previously sent them. Just so it's clear, the deadline for our RFP response is 21st March 2023, which is two weeks from now. 14/03/2023-  A delay in finalizing the RFP documentation is due to us waiting for input from Product Marketing, particularly about our road map and customer-relevant details. Also, the DPA section of the RFP is still to be concluded by our data privacy department. 20/03/2023- As of this morning, our RFP response was submitted, projecting an annual licensing fee of $350K and an implementation cost of $200K. 25/03/2023- A session has been arranged by the client who also sent invites for a Q and A about our response - attendance from all critical stakeholders on the BA side is mandatory. 27/03/2023- The Q and A session went quite positively. We covered each of their queries comprehensively and I put forward the idea of a tailored Post RFP workshop to guide them through a structured demo which mirrors all their operational cases. 28/03/2023- In alignment with the customer's request, we're scheduled to deliver a workshop on the 14th of April. Our solution consulting team is working behind-the-scenes to set up the demo environment. 30/03/2023- Geoff Gables, the VP Sales, and my main contact therein confirmed they're in the midst of appraising their internal budget, which involves multiple approval steps. Their final approval conference is on 21st April 2023. Also, when questioned about the budget they are aiming to get, they indicated it would be adequate to fund the solution's requirements without disclosing the exact number. 14/04/2023- The 4-hour long demo session proceeded exceedingly well with key stakeholders such as Jim Jackson, the Economic Buyer and Head of Operations present. All the main assigned topics, many questions about service delivery as well as the SOW were addressed. The follow-up action is to construct the SOW. I suggested organizing a Value Engineering session to draft a proof of Value document, and they were in agreement. We decided to commence the Value Engineering Session on 21st April. 21/04/2023- We finished our value engineering call, and the POV document will be with them by week's end of the week. 27/04/2023 - Expressed an opinion about value engineering. 28/04/2023- Began working on the SOW in-house with an objective to wrap up with the finalized implementation program by 5th May 2023. 05/05/2023- Total services of 195K were included in the SOW delivered to the client. 07/05/2023- SOW meeting with the customer set to discuss project plan and timeline in greater detail. 10/05/2023- I asked Geoff Gables, my Champion, about our target timeline for announcing VOC – he let me know it should be by the close of next week. 17/05/2023- Next week, we'll have our first call with Procurement, which comes as a result of us being awarded VOC and initiating a dialogue with them. 25/05/2023- The procurement team has communicated in a recent call that for any forward movement, there's a need to lower our prices on a broad scale. 26/05/2023- Our meeting with the internal management resulted in an agreement to slash prices by an additional 5%. It's important to note that this is supplementary to the 20% reduction from the list price on our RFP and it applies only to deals sealed by June end. 27/05/2023- Today's meeting with the EC and the champion addressed the need to build a Mutual Activity Plan for completing any outstanding items. 27/05/2023- To initiate the process of the terms through the client's legal team, please send the Order form and MSA today. 29/05/2023- An appointment with both the Legal department and our legal squad has been arranged for 7/06/2023. 30/05/2023- The EB and I discussed a termination clause for convenience, and though he suggested it, I clarified that our revenue recognition requirements prevent it but agreed to add a termination for cause clause. 07/06/2023- The preliminary legal meeting to communicate their views on the contract was promising. Nonetheless, we still need to clarify some questions on Termination for convenience and Support terms. 09/06/2023- Having addressed the redlines from the clients, we sent back the contract. 10/06/2023- I've assembled the MAP today and dispatched the template for the client's examination. 15/06/2023- It was confirmed by Legal today that the MSA meets their needs and they will pass it to procurement for the process of signature. 20/06/2023- I discovered today that the signatory will be off until July 4th. I reasserted that our pricing is valid until the end of June, and we need an alternative signatory. 26/06/2023- The back-up signing authority has been recognized as Ian Harper, the COO, and the contract is now in for his signature. 30/06/2023- We signed the contract today, and the order form is likely to appear tomorrow, despite bearing a date of June 30th - due to last minute issues, a few minor adjustments have been made by our Sales Ops. 01/07/2023- Deal completion confirmed - Order form sanctioned and purchase order attained.``` Based on the information given in triple quotes, What all are the Sales Agent Actions that worked well in Account opportunity?"}, {"role": "assistant","content":"Undertook an initial discovery call with the VP of Sales to discern pain points and essential requirements.

They're striving to upgrade their service for existing clients by enhancing the customer success rates and, in turn, securing their renewal rates. Salesforce, Gong.io, and Outreach are the platforms they use for early stage lead generation. Consented to proceed with the solution's practical demonstration.

A call has to be set between our product management squad and their team, so as to convince them about the possibility of the integration work. In addition, there was some concern around data privacy which they need their Data Privacy team to look into. They've been asked by me to forward their DPA to us, hopefully before this week concludes. 14/01/2023- Agenda Items: A holistic needs review was performed in collaboration with Account, with a specific focus on their unique challenges. Delved into how incorporating an AI software solution could confidently alleviate these challenges. 21/01/2023- Undertook a meeting for the purpose of discussing data safety and confidentiality concerns tied to the use of our AI software solution.

The client remains non-committal to using our template - the awaited RFP document is still in the pipeline. 28/02/2023- The prioritization of internal matters within the stakeholder team has resulted in a delay of the project and the RFP document for a couple of weeks. 07/03/2023- The RFP document, which seems to adopt the customer's personal template, has been made available. Yet, its resemblance to many aspects of our own template is quite noticeable, leading me to suspect that components from what I previously sent were fused into it.

He didn't disclose a specific figure when I inquired about the level of budget they were targeting, but conveyed it would be enough to meet solution needs. 14/04/2023-  A four-hour demo session turned out to be very effective with all stakeholders in attendance, including Economic Buyer Jim Jackson, the Head of Operations. We managed to cover their main concerns, with a few queries arising about service delivery and SOW. To build out the SOW is our next move. I offered to set up a Value Engineering session to generate a Proof of Value document, to which they consented.

They communicated that the sales process is overly detailed and recommended an effort to streamline this, along with increasing the average deal size. They plan to enhance their provision for existing clients by maximizing the customer success rates, which should help safe-guard their renewal rates. The initial phase of their lead generation employs Salesforce, Gong.io, as well as Outreach. Decided to proceed with a solution demonstration. Their operations are disrupted by a surfeit of disjointed sales systems. We aspire to introduce a unified front on our platform, where users can accomplish most of their tasks. 17/12/2022- Dispatched the Non-Disclosure Agreement for signature. 20/12/2022-  I am still waiting on the NDA to be returned. Furthermore, I've initiated conversation via email with Jim Jackson, the head of operations, in order to introduce myself and Dealstream, as well as to possibly incorporate him in the planned demo session. 23/12/2022-  Emailed the stakeholders to accelerate the NDA process, while proposing suitable dates and times for the demonstration. 01/01/2023- After receiving the returned NDA, we were in agreement that the best date for the demonstration would be 7th January 2023. Ken was then contacted through email to get the names of the attendees and pass that information to us. 07/01/2023- The demo session was effective and productive. They affirmed their liking for the UI/UX, yet, held that assurance was required for the integration with their extensive tech suite, including Gong. It is vital to have a dialogue with their team along with our product management to ensure them of the viability of this integration process. In addition, there was some concern around data privacy which they need their Data Privacy team to look into. I've directed them to provide their DPA to us; we should hopefully receive it by the end of this week. 14/01/2023- Session highlights: Undertook a comprehensive needs study engaging Account, reviewing specific hardships they endure. Explored the potential of AI software solutions in effectively mitigating these obstacles. 21/01/2023- Hosted a dialogue to review data privacy and security concerns pertaining to the AI software solution. We also evaluated how well the solution complies with data protection requirements set by Account. 22/01/2023- Provided a product demo to display the significant features and capabilities of an AI software solution. Unveiled its potential integration into Account' pre-existing infrastructure to enhance operational processes. 30/01/2023- Attended to questions and concerns that arose subsequent to the product demo. Covered technical aspects, integration needs, and the possible ROI that Account could foresee. 07/02/2023- Exhibited a personalized proposition describing the AI software system, its unique benefits, and how it will accommodate Account' needs. Further, discussed the price setting decisions and possible timeline for them to be implemented. 14/02/2023- The client pointed out they are contemplating sending RFPs to approximately five available solutions, with the RFP release date set for sometime within the next three weeks, or by the 28th of Feb 2023 at the latest. I am working together with our internal RFP team to create a suitable RFP template to hand over to the client.  21/02/2023- After submitting our RFP template to the client, we discovered they are also considering Humantics AI and FairSale. So far the client has not decided to use our template, and we are still awaiting their RFP document. 28/02/2023- The project and the RFP document are on hold for a couple of weeks due to the internal focus of the stakeholder team. 07/03/2023- The customer’s revised RFP document has been distributed. I can't help but notice that, although it primarily uses their template, there are several similarities with our own. It's possible that they incorporated some of the materials I sent earlier. An important thing to remember is that our response to the RFP is expected by the 21st of March 2023, that is, two weeks from now. 14/03/2023- The RFP documentation is not done yet, owing to the feedback we're expecting from Product Marketing on our strategy and customer-committed elements. The DPA section of the RFP is also awaiting completion by our data privacy department. 20/03/2023- This morning, we submitted an RFP response, placing the annual cost for licenses at $350K and implementation at 200K. 25/03/2023- An interactive session has been planned by the client who has also sent out invites to a Q and A discussion regarding our actions - all BA side stakeholders are urged to participate.  27/03/2023- The Q and A session was excellent, we managed to answer all of their queries. I proposed that we set up a customized Post RFP workshop to show them a tailored demo that covers all of their use cases. 28/03/2023- Our client has requested us to hold the workshop on the 14th April. Collaboratively, we're working with our solution consulting team internally to set up a demo environment. 30/03/2023- During a conversation with Geoff Gables, the VP Sales and a critical resource, he mentioned they're currently in the throes of securing their internal budget. There are a few stages of approval, with the last one scheduled for 21st April 2023. Although unable to give an exact figure, he said they're aiming for a budget large enough to cover all aspects of the needed solution. 14/04/2023- The demo session went splendidly, it spanned over 4 hours, and all key stakeholders were present, including Economic Buyer, Jim Jackson, and the Head of Operations. We covered all their main topics, and a few inquiries arose related to service delivery and SOW. The next crucial move is to establish the SOW. I suggested going in for a Value Engineering session for the creation of a Proof of Value document, and they agreed. We decided to begin this session on April 21st. 21/04/2023- Successfully wrapped up the value engineering call, and we are aiming to have the POV document with them by the week's end. 27/04/2023 - Supplied a viewpoint on the topic of value engineering. 28/04/2023- Made a start on the internal handling of the SOW, setting the goal to finish off with the final implementation program by the 5th May 2023. 05/05/2023- With total services amounting to 195K, the SOW was delivered to the client. 07/05/2023- Planned SOW call, targeting a detailed conversation with the customer about the project plan and timeline. 10/05/2023- Geoff Gables, the Champion I'm working with, informed me upon asking that the VOC disclosure should be by next week's end. 17/05/2023- We've recently been granted the VOC award and have started conversations with Procurement as a result. Our initial consultation with them is expected to happen the following week. 25/05/2023- Upon chatting with the procurement team, it's clear that we'll need a widespread reduction in price to continue moving forward. 26/05/2023-  Upon deliberation with internal management, we've agreed to proffer a 5% discount to the already 20% discounted RFP price, provided the deal is finalized by June end. 27/05/2023- A meeting was held today with the EC and the champion to discuss the formation of a Mutual Activity Plan, which will guide us in completing all remaining tasks. 27/05/2023- To expedite processing of the terms by their legal team, the MSA and Order form need to be sent to the client today. 29/05/2023- Both the Legal team and our legal unit are booked for a meeting on 7/06/2023. 30/05/2023- The EB suggested a termination for convenience clause in our conversation, to which I responded that our revenue recognition obligations wouldn't permit it, but a termination for cause would definitely be included. 07/06/2023- The initial court-ordained discussion about their perspectives on the contract went smoothly, but we still have some unresolved issues about Termination for convenience and Support terms to sort out. 09/06/2023- Addressing the clients' redlines, we then returned the contract. 10/06/2023- Currently, the MAP was built by me, followed by the template being sent to the client for consideration. 15/06/2023- Today, Legal team endorsed the MSA and will dispatch it to procurement to instigate the signing process. 20/06/2023- I stumbled upon the information today that our authorised signatory is on a holiday until July 4th. I reinstated that our price hold is active until the 30th of June, and the search for a supplementary signatory is crucial. 26/06/2023- COO Ian Harper has been identified as the back-up signatory and the contract is now in for his approval. 30/06/2023- We finalized the contract today and anticipate the order form by tomorrow, but it will be marked as 30th June - our Sales Ops team is making some small changes due to last-minute concerns on the order form. 01/07/2023- Deal finalized - marked by the purchase order's receipt and the signing of the order form.``` Based on the information given in triple quotes, What all are the Sales Agent Actions that worked well in Account opportunity?"}, {"role": "assistant","content":"Had an early morning chat with the VP of Sales, with an aim to recognize the main issues and stipulations. We dispatched the NDA in good time for signature. Emailed stakeholders in an effort to advocate for the NDA. Sent an email to Jim Jackson, the head of operations, to introduce both myself and Dealstream, hoping to possibly invite him to the upcoming demo session. Emailed Champion seeking to confirm the identity of the stakeholder attendee for the demonstration. Arrange a call for the client and our product management team to discuss integration requirements. Inquired for the client's Data Privacy Agreement (DPA), asking them to send it over. Managed an all-encompassing needs exploration to acknowledge the discomforts and challenges the clients deal with. Discussed Data Privacy considerations at a meeting held early in the deal cycle. Arrange a practical demonstration that will detail how to incorporate the solution into their existing systems. The client's issues and inquiries were instantly tackled after presenting the demo.

Phoned my Champion Geoff Gables to learn about the projected date for releasing the VOC. We've held talks with our management team and agreed to provide an extra 5% discount, considering we've already reduced the RFP price by 20% from the list. The offer is predicated on a June-end closure. In our meeting today with the EC and the champion, we broached planning a Mutual Activity Plan to guide us all towards wrapping up any lagging items. To aid the client's legal team in processing the terms, please make sure the MSA and Order form are sent today. Turning down the request for termination for convenience was necessitated by our revenue recognition requirements, but allowing for termination for cause is provided. Set up the Mutual Activity Plan (MAP) and dispatched the format to the client for their scrutiny. Re made clear that our pricing structure holds firm until the end of June, and we need to ensure a redundant signatory due to non-availability."}]}

This step will ensure we work together to finalize all overdue tasks. Send the MSA and Order form to the client today, so the terms can be processed by their team of lawyers.

They suggested that the sales process is too intricate and requires streamlining, in addition to an increase in the average deal size. Their goal is to improve customer success rates, allowing them to better service their current clients and safeguard their renewal rates. For their early stage lead generation, they utilize Salesforce, Gong.io, and Outreach. Gave the nod to proceed with a demonstration of the solution. They are dealing with a multitude of inconsistent sales systems. Aiming to offer a unified, seamless platform where most tasks can be performed within a single application. 17/12/2022- Dispatched the NDA for signing. 20/12/2022- I'm yet to receive the returned NDA. Additionally, I've reached out to Jim Jackson, the head of operations, to introduce myself and Dealstream, in the hopes of possibly involving him in our upcoming demo session. 23/12/2022- Wrote to stakeholders encouraging them to push for the NDA and suggesting appropriate dates and times for the demonstration. 01/01/2023- Ken was emailed following the NDA's return, with the 7th January 2023 confirmed as the optimal date for the session. He was asked to pinpoint and notify us about the demonstration attendees. 07/01/2023- The demonstration session proceeded smoothly. They expressed their satisfaction with the UI/UX, yet they stressed the need to confirm if we can integrate with their entire tech stack, including Gong. We need to arrange a conference call between their team and our product management team to assure them that the task of integration can be effectively carried out. In addition, there was some concern around data privacy which they need their Data Privacy team to look into. I've requested that they share their DPA with us, hopefully by the end of this week. 14/01/2023- Topics Covered: Carried out a detailed needs analysis with Account, examining specific aspects they struggle with. Explored how the AI software solution could rectify these issues effectively. 21/01/2023- Convened an assembly focused on deliberating over data privacy and security concerns surrounding our AI software solution. Explored how it aligns with Account' data protection guidelines. 22/01/2023- Conducted a product demo featuring the utmost features and capabilities of an AI software solution. Showed how it could be seamlessly incorporated into Account' existing systems for operational enhancement. 30/01/2023- Answered queries and alleviated concerns that emerged post the product demonstration. Explained the technical matters, integration needs, and possible return on investment that could be anticipated by Account. 07/02/2023- Outlined a customized proposal presenting the AI software solution, its advantages, and its compatibility with the specific requirements of Account. Also, conversed on pricing structures and possible execution schedules. 14/02/2023- The client noted they're considering sending RFPs to about five solutions and plan to release the RFP within the upcoming three weeks at the latest, by February 28th, 2023. I am collaborating with the internal RFP team to furnish a suitable RFP template for the client to use. 21/02/2023- Dispatched the RFP template to the client, and found out that our competitors are Humantics AI and FairSale. We're still waiting for the client's commitment to use our template and return the RFP document to us. 28/02/2023- The stakeholder team's internal priorities have caused a delay in the RFP document and stalled the project for several weeks. 07/03/2023- The RFP document has been issued, and it appears to be the customer's own template. However, I have noticed a number of similarities to our own template. I suspect that they incorporated some aspects from what I sent them. As per the schedule, the RFP response is due on 21st March 2023, which is around two weeks from today. 14/03/2023- We are still awaiting feedback from our Product Marketing team regarding our road map—information required for completing the RFP documentation. Also, our data privacy team is yet to complete the DPA section of the RFP. 20/03/2023- This morning, I submitted a RFP response that included a quote of $350K per year for licenses and $200K for implementation. 25/03/2023- An appointment has been scheduled by the client, and invitations have been dispatched for a Q&A regarding our feedback - all principal stakeholders from the BA side are expected to attend. 27/03/2023- Our Q and A session was highly successful; we addressed all their concerns. Additionally, I suggested conducting a bespoke Post RFP workshop so we could walk them through a configured demo that encapsulates all their use cases. 28/03/2023-  The customer has requested that we conduct the workshop on 14th April. We are collaborating internally with the solution consulting group to ready the demo environment. 30/03/2023- In a conversation with Geoff Gables, the VP Sales and my primary contact, he mentioned that they are still securing their internal budget. They are going through several rounds of approval and the final one is slated for 21st April 2023. When asked about the budget they're trying to secure, Geoff didn't provide an exact figure but specified it would be enough to meet the solution's requirements. 14/04/2023- The demo session was a great success - with a duration of 4 hours, all stakeholders, including our Economic Buyer Jim Jackson, the Head of Operations, were present. We discussed all their major issues and answered queries related to service delivery and SOW. The next step is to finalize the SOW. I put forth the idea of a Value Engineering session to create a Proof of Value document, which they accepted. We've agreed to initiate the Value Engineering Session on April 21st. 21/04/2023- We successfully concluded the value engineering call and plan to provide them with the POV document by the conclusion of week. 27/04/2023 - Presented a point of view on value engineering. 28/04/2023- Initiated in-house work on the SOW, with a goal to complete the SOW and its final implementation program by May 5th, 2023. 05/05/2023- The SOW was delivered to the client with total services amounting to 195K. 07/05/2023- Call with the client to elaborate on the timeline and project plan in a SOW meeting. 10/05/2023- I spoke with my Champion, Geoff Gables, and inquired about the VOC announcement's intended date - he confirmed it should be by the end of next week. 17/05/2023- Having received the VOC award, we've now transitioned to engaging in discussions with Procurement. Our initial meeting with them is scheduled for the following week. 25/05/2023- In a conversation with the procurement department, they mentioned we have to decrease our pricing throughout all our products to progress. 26/05/2023- In consultation with internal management, it was agreed to provide a 5% additional discount if the deal is closed by the end of June. This comes after our RFP price was earlier marked down by 20% from the list price. 27/05/2023- In today's meeting with both the EC and the champion, we discussed creating a Mutual Activity Plan for closing all outstanding items. 27/05/2023- Today, send the Order form and the MSA to the client so their legal team can process the terms. 29/05/2023- The meet-up with the legal team and our own law professionals is set for 7/06/2023. 30/05/2023- During a conversation with the EB, he suggested including a termination for convenience clause. However, I expressed our inability to do so due to our revenue recognition requirements and instead, offered to include a termination for cause clause. 07/06/2023- The initial legal discussion concerning their contract points proceeded smoothly, though there are still some unresolved issues about Termination for convenience and Support terms. 09/06/2023- We dealt with the clients' redlines and gave back the contract. 10/06/2023- Today, I created the MAP and forwarded the template to the client for their perusal. 15/06/2023- Today, Legal confirmed their satisfaction with the MSA and will forward it for procurement to initiate the signing process. 20/06/2023- I found out today that the authorized signatory is away until the 4th of July. I reminded them that our price remains the same until the end of June, and we need to identify a substitute signatory. 26/06/2023- Ian Harper, the COO, has been identified as the back-up signatory and the contract is in for his signature. 30/06/2023- Today, the contract has been signed and expected to receive the order form by tomorrow, though it would be dated June 30th - last minute modifications on a few minor terms have been made by our Sales Ops. 01/07/2023- The deal is finalized - order form has been signed and purchase order obtained.``` Based on the information given in triple quotes, identify the problems that the sales agent encountered during the Account opportunity."}, {"role": "assistant","content":"Postponed NDA.

They highlighted that the sales system is quite complex and needs simplification, and there is also a necessity to raise the average transaction size. They aspire to enhance the success rates of their customers to better serve their existing clients and uphold their renewal rates. They employ Salesforce and Gong.io, in addition to Outreach, for the initial stages of lead generation. Decided to pursue a demonstration of the proposed solution. The number of uncoordinated sales systems they have is overwhelming. We aim to provide a seamless, integrated platform experience that will let users handle most of their work in one application. 17/12/2022- The NDA has been sent for signature. 20/12/2022- I am still waiting for the NDA to be returned.

Ken received an email to specify and give us information about those who will be attending the session. 07/01/2023- Everything went well in the demo session. While they appreciated the UI/UX, they declared that integration with their tech stack including Gong must be guaranteed. It's necessary to schedule a call with their team and our product management group to instill confidence that this integration project is feasible. In addition, there was some concern around data privacy which they need their Data Privacy team to look into.  I've urged them to transmit their DPA to us, potentially by the week's end. 14/01/2023- Key Takeaways: Undertook a thorough needs assessment involving Account. Identifying specific difficulties and obstacles they encounter. Talked about how the implementation of AI software solution could tackle these problems successfully. 21/01/2023- Had a conference where the key topic was data protection and security implications of our AI software solution.

Their plan is to have the RFP sent out within the next three weeks, no later than February 28th, 2023. I am liaising with our internal RFP team to prepare a proper template for the client. 21/02/2023- The client received our RFP template, but we discovered our competition includes Humantics AI and FairSale. The client hasn't confirmed they'll use our template, and is yet to provide the RFP document. 28/02/2023- Due to the internal priorities of the stakeholder team, the project has been delayed for a couple of weeks, and so has the RFP document. 07/03/2023- We have received the RFP document which seems to be based on the customer's personal template. Interestingly, it contains several points that coincide with our template. It makes me think that they have used parts of the data I shared with them. And just to update you, the deadline to respond to the RFP is the 21st March 2023, two weeks from today. 14/03/2023- The RFP documentation is still in the process of being completed while we await feedback from Product Marketing about what components can be included in the customer response. Additionally, we are waiting for the data privacy team to finalize the DPA section of the RFP. 20/03/2023- I finalized and submitted our RFP response today, proposing an annual rate of $350K for licenses and an implementation fee of $200K. 25/03/2023-  A meeting has been established, and the client sent out invites for a Q&A on our response - all essential BA side stakeholders must attend. 27/03/2023- The Q and A session unfolded favorably and we responded to every point they had.

Our solution consulting team is in the process of preparing the demo environment internally. 30/03/2023- The conversation I had with my key champion, Geoff Gables who is the VP Sales, revolved around their current internal budgeting process. It appears there are several approval stages with the final approval set for 21st April 2023. They couldn't provide an exact budget but stated it would suffice to cover the solution's requirements. 14/04/2023- Our 4-hour demo session was very productive with all stakeholders present, including Jim Jackson, the Economic Buyer and Head of Operations. We addressed all the key points they raised, along with some questions about service delivery and the Statement of Work (SOW). We agreed on my proposal to develop a value engineering session to formulate a Proof of Value document. The session is scheduled to begin on April 21st. 21/04/2023- The value engineering call has been completed and we must have the POV document with them by the termination of week. 27/04/2023 - Conveyed a perspective about value engineering. 28/04/2023- Commenced internal work on the SOW, targeting to finalize with the implementation program on 5th May 2023. 05/05/2023- The client received the SOW, the cost of all services amounted to 195K. 07/05/2023- SOW call scheduled with the customer to delve deeper into the specifics of the timeline and project plan.  10/05/2023- My Champion, Geoff Gables, was contacted by me, and he stated that the target date for the VOC announcement will be by the end of the coming week.  17/05/2023- We are pleased to announce that we've been awarded the VOC, and have subsequently begun consultations with Procurement. The inaugural contact with Procurement will take place in the coming week. 25/05/2023- We just had a discussion with procurement and they informed us that price reduction across all areas is necessary for any advancement. 26/05/2023- After conferring with our internal management, we've decided to grant an extra 5% discount on the already 20%-reduced RFP price, but on the condition that the deal closes by the end of June. 27/05/2023- Constructing a Mutual Activity Plan was the main topic discussed in the meeting with the EC and the champion today, that is intended to help us resolve all outstanding items. 27/05/2023- The MSA and Order form should be sent to the client today for their legal team's processing of the terms. 29/05/2023- Both our legal team and the additional Legal team are planned to meet on 7/06/2023. 30/05/2023- When the EB and I spoke, he insisted on a termination clause for convenience. Despite this proposal, I told him it was impossible due to our revenue recognition prerequisites, but agreed to a termination clause for cause. 07/06/2023- Our first official call to talk through their points on contract was successful.

They pointed out that the sales operation is excessively detailed, needing streamlining, and an increase in the average deal size is also necessary. They aim to strengthen their services for existing clients by improving their customer success rates, which would also help maintain their renewal rates. Their early stage lead generation involves the use of Salesforce, Gong.io, and Outreach. Concurred to advance with showing a solution demo. They suffer from having too many unconnected sales systems. Our goal is to provide a smooth and combined platform experience where the user can accomplish much of the work in one program. 17/12/2022- Delivered the NDA for endorsement. 20/12/2022- I've yet to get a returned NDA. Moreover, I emailed Jim Jackson, the chief of operations, to present myself and Dealstream, contemplating his possible participation in our planned demo session. 23/12/2022- Reached out to stakeholders via email to lobby for the NDA and to propose optimal dates/times for the demonstration. 01/01/2023- Ken was tasked, through an email, with identifying and informing us about the attendees for the demonstration session, scheduled for the 7th January 2023 following the return of the NDA. 07/01/2023- The demo session was successful. They communicated their admiration for the UI/UX, but also emphasized the importance of a successful integration with their entire tech stack, particularly Gong. We must set a meeting with their team and our product management department to reassure them that we're capable of carrying out this integration task. In addition, there was some concern around data privacy which they need their Data Privacy team to look into. I have implored them to dispatch their DPA to us, ideally before the end of the week. 14/01/2023- Points of Discussion: Conducted a broad-based needs evaluation with Account. Discussed in detail the particular issues and struggles they deal with. Examined how an AI software solution could potentially solve these issues. 21/01/2023- Organized a discussion forum to go over issues concerning data privacy and security of the AI software solution. We also clarified how the solution fulfills Account' data safety protocols. 22/01/2023- Organized a product demonstration to showcase the distinguishing features of our AI software solution. Explained its possible integration within Account' existing systems to optimize their workflows and operations. 30/01/2023- Responded to questions and resolved issues that appeared following the product demo. Provided clarity on technical dimensions, integration demands, and prospective ROI available for Account. 07/02/2023- Provided a bespoke proposal explaining the relevance of the AI software solution, how beneficial it is, and how it matches Account' needs. Pricing options and likely implementation timelines were also discussed. 14/02/2023-  It was suggested by the customer they are planning to submit RFPs to around five solutions. It’s expected to be released over the coming three weeks, but not later than 28th Feb 2023. I'm teaming up with our in-house RFP department to create an RFP template for the client. 21/02/2023- Found out that Humantics AI and FairSale are our competitors after sending the client our RFP template. We haven't heard from them regarding their commitment to our template and we're waiting for them to return the RFP document. 28/02/2023- The project, as well as the RFP document, has been put on hold for a couple of weeks due to the internal priorities of the stakeholder team. 07/03/2023-  I've noticed that the released RFP document, even though based on the customer's own template, shares a number of similarities with ours. They may have included some aspects from the material I previously sent them. Just so it's clear, the deadline for our RFP response is 21st March 2023, which is two weeks from now. 14/03/2023-  A delay in finalizing the RFP documentation is due to us waiting for input from Product Marketing, particularly about our road map and customer-relevant details. Also, the DPA section of the RFP is still to be concluded by our data privacy department. 20/03/2023- As of this morning, our RFP response was submitted, projecting an annual licensing fee of $350K and an implementation cost of $200K. 25/03/2023- A session has been arranged by the client who also sent invites for a Q and A about our response - attendance from all critical stakeholders on the BA side is mandatory. 27/03/2023- The Q and A session went quite positively. We covered each of their queries comprehensively and I put forward the idea of a tailored Post RFP workshop to guide them through a structured demo which mirrors all their operational cases. 28/03/2023- In alignment with the customer's request, we're scheduled to deliver a workshop on the 14th of April. Our solution consulting team is working behind-the-scenes to set up the demo environment. 30/03/2023- Geoff Gables, the VP Sales, and my main contact therein confirmed they're in the midst of appraising their internal budget, which involves multiple approval steps. Their final approval conference is on 21st April 2023. Also, when questioned about the budget they are aiming to get, they indicated it would be adequate to fund the solution's requirements without disclosing the exact number. 14/04/2023- The 4-hour long demo session proceeded exceedingly well with key stakeholders such as Jim Jackson, the Economic Buyer and Head of Operations present. All the main assigned topics, many questions about service delivery as well as the SOW were addressed. The follow-up action is to construct the SOW. I suggested organizing a Value Engineering session to draft a proof of Value document, and they were in agreement. We decided to commence the Value Engineering Session on 21st April. 21/04/2023- We finished our value engineering call, and the POV document will be with them by week's end of the week. 27/04/2023 - Expressed an opinion about value engineering. 28/04/2023- Began working on the SOW in-house with an objective to wrap up with the finalized implementation program by 5th May 2023. 05/05/2023- Total services of 195K were included in the SOW delivered to the client. 07/05/2023- SOW meeting with the customer set to discuss project plan and timeline in greater detail. 10/05/2023- I asked Geoff Gables, my Champion, about our target timeline for announcing VOC – he let me know it should be by the close of next week. 17/05/2023- Next week, we'll have our first call with Procurement, which comes as a result of us being awarded VOC and initiating a dialogue with them. 25/05/2023- The procurement team has communicated in a recent call that for any forward movement, there's a need to lower our prices on a broad scale. 26/05/2023- Our meeting with the internal management resulted in an agreement to slash prices by an additional 5%. It's important to note that this is supplementary to the 20% reduction from the list price on our RFP and it applies only to deals sealed by June end. 27/05/2023- Today's meeting with the EC and the champion addressed the need to build a Mutual Activity Plan for completing any outstanding items. 27/05/2023- To initiate the process of the terms through the client's legal team, please send the Order form and MSA today. 29/05/2023- An appointment with both the Legal department and our legal squad has been arranged for 7/06/2023. 30/05/2023- The EB and I discussed a termination clause for convenience, and though he suggested it, I clarified that our revenue recognition requirements prevent it but agreed to add a termination for cause clause. 07/06/2023- The preliminary legal meeting to communicate their views on the contract was promising. Nonetheless, we still need to clarify some questions on Termination for convenience and Support terms. 09/06/2023- Having addressed the redlines from the clients, we sent back the contract. 10/06/2023- I've assembled the MAP today and dispatched the template for the client's examination. 15/06/2023- It was confirmed by Legal today that the MSA meets their needs and they will pass it to procurement for the process of signature. 20/06/2023- I discovered today that the signatory will be off until July 4th.

Regarding their criticisms, they mentioned that the sales process appears convoluted and thus needs optimization, furthermore the average deal size needs expansion. They're striving to upgrade their service for existing clients by enhancing the customer success rates and, in turn, securing their renewal rates. Salesforce, Gong.io, and Outreach are the platforms they use for early stage lead generation. Consented to proceed with the solution's practical demonstration. The plethora of inconsistent sales systems they have at their disposal is too much. We seek to offer a single-stop platform that enables the user to perform the lion's share of their work. 17/12/2022- Transmitted the NDA for approval. 20/12/2022- I'm currently waiting for the NDA to be returned. I also decided to introduce myself and Dealstream to Jim Jackson, the head of operations, with a thought of including him in the demo session we are planning.  23/12/2022- Emailed stakeholders to advance the NDA and suggest ideal demonstration times. 01/01/2023- After the NDA returned, we settled on the 7th January, 2023 as the appropriate date for the demonstration. An email was sent to Ken for the purpose of determining and keeping us posted about the session attendees. 07/01/2023- We accomplished a lot in the demo session. They made clear their love for the UI/UX while also stressing that integrating with their full tech stack, especially Gong, is a prerequisite. A call has to be set between our product management squad and their team, so as to convince them about the possibility of the integration work. In addition, there was some concern around data privacy which they need their Data Privacy team to look into. They've been asked by me to forward their DPA to us, hopefully before this week concludes. 14/01/2023- Agenda Items: A holistic needs review was performed in collaboration with Account, with a specific focus on their unique challenges. Delved into how incorporating an AI software solution could confidently alleviate these challenges. 21/01/2023- Undertook a meeting for the purpose of discussing data safety and confidentiality concerns tied to the use of our AI software solution. We also conversed about the solution's adherence to Account' data safeguarding rules. 22/01/2023- Facilitated a product demo, presenting the unique features of an AI software solution. Illustrated its potential for integration with Account' current systems, thereby amplifying the efficiency of their operations. 30/01/2023- Handled questions and worries that presented themselves after demonstrating the product. Explained technical characteristics, integration necessities, and the likely return on investment for Account. 07/02/2023- Showcased a made-to-order proposal laying out the AI software solution, its valuable aspects, and how it meets with the needs of Account. Talked about various pricing models and probable roll-out timelines. 14/02/2023- The customer specified plans to dispatch RFPs to an estimated five solutions, intending to release the RFP within a maximum of three weeks, by 28th Feb 2023. Currently, I'm cooperating with our internal RFP crew to supply the client with a suitable RFP model for his use. 21/02/2023- The RFP template has been given to the client, while we've found out that companies we're competing with are Humantics AI and FairSale. The client remains non-committal to using our template - the awaited RFP document is still in the pipeline. 28/02/2023- The prioritization of internal matters within the stakeholder team has resulted in a delay of the project and the RFP document for a couple of weeks. 07/03/2023- The RFP document, which seems to adopt the customer's personal template, has been made available. Yet, its resemblance to many aspects of our own template is quite noticeable, leading me to suspect that components from what I previously sent were fused into it. For your information, the deadline for our RFP response is set for two weeks from today, precisely on the 21st of March 2023. 14/03/2023- We have yet to complete RFP documentation as we are waiting on feedback from Product Marketing about our road map and related information. We are also awaiting completion of the DPA section of the RFP by our data privacy specialists. 20/03/2023- Finished compiling our RFP response and sent it in today, with an annual license fee of $350K and $200K for implementation. 25/03/2023- Invitations have been dispatched by the client for a planned session that includes a Q and A about our feedback – all important stakeholders from BA should be present. 27/03/2023- Our question and answer session was remarkably successful, as we addressed all of their points.

We're teaming up with the solution consulting department internally to get the demo environment ready. 30/03/2023- Geoff Gables, Sales VP and my primary champion, indicated they're in the process of internally securing budget, which seems to be in a few stages of approval with the final segment due on 21st April 2023. He didn't disclose a specific figure when I inquired about the level of budget they were targeting, but conveyed it would be enough to meet solution needs. 14/04/2023-  A four-hour demo session turned out to be very effective with all stakeholders in attendance, including Economic Buyer Jim Jackson, the Head of Operations. We managed to cover their main concerns, with a few queries arising about service delivery and SOW. To build out the SOW is our next move. I offered to set up a Value Engineering session to generate a Proof of Value document, to which they consented. We consented to launch the Value Engineering Session on April 21st. 21/04/2023- Our value engineering call is complete and we'll make sure they have the POV document by the close of week. 27/04/2023 - Delivered a standpoint on value engineering. 28/04/2023- Kick-started the work on the SOW internally, with plans to present the final implementation program by the 5th of May, 2023. 05/05/2023- Handed over the SOW to the client with total services costing 195K. 07/05/2023- An in-depth discussion planned for the SOW call with the customer about the project timeline and plan. 10/05/2023- Got into contact with my Champion Geoff Gables and questioned when the VOC is scheduled to be declared - he declared it would be by next week's end.  17/05/2023- VOC recognition has been bestowed upon us, and we've moved forward to discussions involving Procurement. We're slated to have our primary call with them in the week ahead. 25/05/2023- Procurement recommended during our call to consider slashing our prices across the entire range if we want to make progress. 26/05/2023- An understanding was reached with the internal management to provide a further 5% discount on the RFP price that was previously decreased by 20%. However, this offer stands only if the transaction concludes by the end of June. 27/05/2023- To close all outstanding items, the EC, the champion, and I met today to talk about constructing a Mutual Activity Plan. 27/05/2023- Dispatch the Order form along with the MSA to the client today, enabling their legal team to process the terms. 29/05/2023- The congregation with the Legal team and our attorneys has been programmed for 7/06/2023. 30/05/2023- During my discussion with the EB, he proposed a termination for convenience clause. I reminded him of our revenue recognition requirements and suggested a termination for cause clause instead. 07/06/2023- Our initial legal discussion about their contract points went well, with some outstanding queries about Termination for convenience and Support terms still to be discussed. 09/06/2023- We responded to the clients' redlines and handed back the contract. 10/06/2023- Today, the MAP has been fabricated by me, and the client was sent a template for reviewing. 15/06/2023- Today, Legal announced their contentment with the MSA and their intention to give it to procurement for furthering the signature procedure. 20/06/2023- Today, it came to my knowledge that the person who signs is on leave until 4th July. I restated that our price is secured until the end of June and another signatory is necessary. 26/06/2023- Identified Ian Harper, the COO, as the back-up signatory and prepared the contract for his signature. 30/06/2023- Today, a contract was signed, an order form is expected tomorrow but the date will still reflect 30th June - our Sales Operations team are tweaking a few minor terms that were brought up at the ultimate moment. 01/07/2023- A secured deal, as the order form has been signed and the purchase order has been accepted.``` Based on the information given in triple quotes, identify the problems that the sales agent encountered during the Account opportunity."}, {"role": "assistant","content":"Procrastinated Nondisclosure Agreement.

They signaled that they were impressed by the UI/ UX, yet stipulated that they need to ensure the compatibility with their comprehensive tech stack including Gong. There is a need to orchestrate a communication with their team and ours specifically from product management, to let them know this integration job can be completed. In addition, there was some concern around data privacy which they need their Data Privacy team to look into. I've asked them to send over their DPA, and with luck, it should arrive by the end of the week. 14/01/2023- Discussed Details: Conducted a thorough needs analysis for Account, while zeroing in on specific problems they grapple with. Explored how an effective solution could be the deployment of a cutting-edge AI software. 21/01/2023- Arranged a gathering to talk through the data security and privacy matters related to our AI software solution.

The RFP should be out anytime within the next three weeks, not exceeding 28th Feb 2023. I am in collaboration with our RFP team internally to deliver a well-crafted RFP template for the client. 21/02/2023- Given our competitors are Humantics AI and FairSale, the client was sent the RFP template. While we still wait for the commitment from the client to use our template, the RFP document is also yet to be received. 28/02/2023- Owing to the internal priorities of the stakeholder team, there's a delay in the RFP document and a two-week pause in the project. 07/03/2023- An RFP document has just been unveiled, and it seems to have been created from the customer's own template. Despite this, I'm seeing quite a few similarities with our own model, suggesting that they might have used some sections from the information I passed on. It's also important to note that we have to submit our response to the RFP proposal by the 21st of March 2023, exactly two weeks from today. 14/03/2023- Feedback from Product Marketing concerning our road map is still pending, therefore the completion of RFP documentation is on hold.

With several rounds of approval, their final sign-off meeting is planned for 21st April 2023. Although he didn't disclose the exact number, he maintained they are looking for a sufficient budget to fulfill the solution's requirements. 14/04/2023- The demo session was a triumph, spanning over 4 hours. All stakeholders were present, including Economic Buyer Jim Jackson, the Head of Operations. We reviewed all the critical points, with a few service delivery and SOW-related queries coming up.

They put forth the view that the sales process in place is more complicated than it needs to be and needs streamlining, in addition to an expansion in the average deal size. Their ambition is to provide better service to their existing clients by increasing their success rates, thereby preserving their renewal rates. Their process of early stage lead generation relies on Salesforce, Gong.io, and Outreach. Settled on proceeding with a demonstration for the solution. They are juggling too many unrelated sales systems. Our aim is to create a comprehensive platform experience, enabling the user to undertake most tasks in a singular application. 17/12/2022- Relayed the NDA for certification. 20/12/2022- The NDA hasn't been returned yet and I'm still waiting.

Furthermore, Ken has been contacted via email to identify and inform us about the expected attendees. 07/01/2023- The demo session proceeded without any hiccups. They expressed their preference for our UI/UX, but the condition was that it would need to integrate seamlessly with their broad tech stack including Gong. Need to establish a networking session with their and our product team to guarantee them that the integration task can be executed. In addition, there was some concern around data privacy which they need their Data Privacy team to look into. I've asked them to share their DPA with us, and they will likely do so by the conclusion of the week. 14/01/2023- Dialogue Summary: Implemented a complete needs analysis involving Account, highlighting and discussing particular issues they have to deal with. Looked into how effective AI software solutions could potentially resolve these challenges. 21/01/2023- Facilitated a session to discuss data safety and privacy implications of the AI software solution in question. We also reviewed its alignment with Account' requisite data protection measures. 22/01/2023- Presented a product demo, pinpointing the chief features and power of our AI software solution. Showed its capability to be merged with Account ' current system, potentially uplifting their operations efficiency. 30/01/2023- Clarified doubts and issues that occurred after the product presentation. Elucidated about the technical details, integration processes and the probable ROI that'll benefit Account. 07/02/2023- Delivered a specialized proposal which observed in detail the AI software solution, its profits, and its harmony to Account' needs. Also, had a dialogue concerning the pricing possibilities and estimated initiation schedules. 14/02/2023- It was stated by the customer that they are inclined to go for RFP with nearly five solutions. The RFP is set to be released no later than the next three weeks or by 28th Feb 2023 to be specific. I am liaising with the internal team in charge of RFP to avail the client with an RFP template to suit their needs. 21/02/2023- We've sent out the RFP template to our client, whilst finding out our competitive field includes Humantics AI and FairSale. The client is yet to decide on using our template, and we're still in the waiting for their RFP document. 28/02/2023- It's the internal priorities of the stakeholder team that have caused a two-week delay in both the project and the RFP document. 07/03/2023- The RFP document that was recently circulated appears to be based mostly on the customer's original template. Yet, it noticeably shares a vast proportion of comparable points with ours, which leads me to believe that they utilized some of the particulars I forwarded to them. Also, the deposition of the RFP response is due in two weeks, dated 21st March 2023. 14/03/2023- The RFP documentation process is not yet completed —we are currently waiting for our Product Marketing team to provide their feedback on our roadmap and the data that can be disclosed to the customer. Our data privacy team is also yet to finish up on the DPA section of the RFP. 20/03/2023- The RFP response that we submitted this morning outlines an annual charge of 350K USD for licenses and 200K for implementation. 25/03/2023- A rendezvous has been scheduled and invites have been sent by the client regarding a Q and A session about our response - all responsible parties from the BA side are required to attend. 27/03/2023- The Q & A session was executed perfectly; we addressed all their issues and I proposed that we instigate a specific Post RFP workshop to exhibit a corresponding demo catering to all of their use cases. 28/03/2023- As requested by the client, the workshop will proceed on the 14th of April. Simultaneously, we're coordinating with our solution consulting team to get the demo environment ready.  30/03/2023- In my recent discussion with my main champion, Geoff Gables who is the VP Sales, he revealed that budget securing process is ongoing. They're undertaking a few rounds of approval which will culminate on 21st April 2023. He was not able to provide a specific number for the budget they are trying to secure but assured it would be enough to cater to the solution requirements. 14/04/2023-  A successful demo session lasted for 4 hours with all key stakeholders including Economic Buyer, Jim Jackson and the Head of Operations gracing the event. We managed to cover all their principal concerns, with a few queries around service delivery and SOW popping up. The next phase involves building out the SOW. I put forth a suggestion to hold a Value Engineering session to design a Proof of Value document, which they agreed to. The session is set to kick off on 21st April. 21/04/2023- Having completed the value engineering call, we commit to having the POV document with them before the conclusion of week. 27/04/2023 - Language about value engineering has been provided. 28/04/2023- We've begun in-house work on the SOW, with a timeline to deliver the completed SOW and its implementation program by 5th May 2023. 05/05/2023- Provided the client with the SOW, totalling services to 195K. 07/05/2023- Customer planned for SOW call to discuss project plan specifics and detailing the timeline. 10/05/2023- During our conversation, Geoff Gables, the Champion, told me that the VOC announcement is planned for the end of next week. 17/05/2023-  With the VOC award under our belt, we've launched into discussion talks with Procurement.

This is over and above the 20% reduction we've made before on our RFP price, with a clause of deal closure by end of June attached. 27/05/2023- Together with the EC and the champion, we pondered over constructing a Mutual Activity Plan today, aiming to resolve all outstanding items. 27/05/2023- Have the client's legal team process the terms by sending them the MSA and Order form today. 29/05/2023- The date for the meeting with the external Legal team and our in-house law team is 7/06/2023. 30/05/2023- An interesting conversation with the EB brought up the need for a termination clause for convenience. I highlighted our revenue recognition requirements which rendered this impossible and gave assurance that a termination for cause clause will be instated instead. 07/06/2023- The primary legal dialogue to address their stances on the contract was effective, although we still retain some contentious points around Termination for convenience and Support terms. 09/06/2023- We managed the clients' redlines and sent the contract back. 10/06/2023- Having constructed the MAP, the template was forwarded to the client today for their review. 15/06/2023- Satisfied with the MSA, Legal today will send it over to procurement to facilitate the endorsement process. 20/06/2023- Today's discovery indicated that the individual who will sign is on break until the 4th of July. I repeated that our prices are stable until the end of June, and we need to pinpoint a back up signatory. 26/06/2023- Ian Harper, COO, has been assigned as the back-up signatory and is currently in possession of the contract to sign. 30/06/2023- Today marked the signing of the contract with the order form on its way tomorrow, despite its June 30th dating - there are a few minor alterations on the order form from our Sales Ops team due to unforeseen last-minute issues. 01/07/2023- Deal concluded successfully - thanks to the receipt of the purchase order and the signed order form.``` Based on the information given in triple quotes, identify the problems that the sales agent encountered during the Account opportunity."}, {"role": "assistant","content":"NDA that has been delayed.

The initial phase of their lead generation employs Salesforce, Gong.io, as well as Outreach. Decided to proceed with a solution demonstration.

They affirmed their liking for the UI/UX, yet, held that assurance was required for the integration with their extensive tech suite, including Gong. It is vital to have a dialogue with their team along with our product management to ensure them of the viability of this integration process.

I am working together with our internal RFP team to create a suitable RFP template to hand over to the client.  21/02/2023- After submitting our RFP template to the client, we discovered they are also considering Humantics AI and FairSale. So far the client has not decided to use our template, and we are still awaiting their RFP document. 28/02/2023- The project and the RFP document are on hold for a couple of weeks due to the internal focus of the stakeholder team. 07/03/2023- The customer’s revised RFP document has been distributed. I can't help but notice that, although it primarily uses their template, there are several similarities with our own. It's possible that they incorporated some of the materials I sent earlier. An important thing to remember is that our response to the RFP is expected by the 21st of March 2023, that is, two weeks from now. 14/03/2023- The RFP documentation is not done yet, owing to the feedback we're expecting from Product Marketing on our strategy and customer-committed elements.

Collaboratively, we're working with our solution consulting team internally to set up a demo environment. 30/03/2023- During a conversation with Geoff Gables, the VP Sales and a critical resource, he mentioned they're currently in the throes of securing their internal budget. There are a few stages of approval, with the last one scheduled for 21st April 2023. Although unable to give an exact figure, he said they're aiming for a budget large enough to cover all aspects of the needed solution. 14/04/2023- The demo session went splendidly, it spanned over 4 hours, and all key stakeholders were present, including Economic Buyer, Jim Jackson, and the Head of Operations. We covered all their main topics, and a few inquiries arose related to service delivery and SOW. The next crucial move is to establish the SOW.

Nonetheless, I informed him about our revenue recognition limitations that made it impossible, hence proposing that a termination for cause clause would be incorporated. 07/06/2023- The first conference to legally discuss their views on the contract was successful, but we are yet to resolve some matters around Termination for convenience and Support terms. 09/06/2023- We handled the redlines from the clients and gave the contract back. 10/06/2023- I constructed the MAP today, then dispatched the template to the client for their evaluation. 15/06/2023- The people from Legal have confirmed today that they are on board with the MSA and will hand it over to procurement to proceed with the authorization process. 20/06/2023- Got the information today that the person responsible for signing is on a vacation until 4th July.

Also emailed Jim Jackson, head of operations, to introduce myself and Dealstream with a view to perhaps including him on the planned demo session. 23/12/2022- Emailed stakeholders to push for the NDA and to suggest suitable dates/times for the demonstration. 01/01/2023- NDA returned and the 7th January 2023 agreed as the best date for the demonstration. Emailed Ken to identify and inform us of the attendees for the session. 07/01/2023- The demo session went well. They indicated that they loved the UI/UX; however, they would need to ensure that the integration with their whole tech stack, including Gong, would be something that we could do. Need to set up a call with their team and our product management team to give them confidence that this integration work can be delivered. In addition, there was some concern around data privacy which they need their Data Privacy team to look into. I have asked them to send us their DPA, which they will hopefully do by the end of the week. 14/01/2023- Discussion Points: Conducted a comprehensive needs analysis with Account. Explored specific pain points and challenges they face. Discussed how the AI software solution could address these challenges effectively. 21/01/2023- Held a meeting to discuss data privacy and security considerations related to the AI software solution. Addressed how the solution complies with Account' data protection requirements. 22/01/2023- Held a product demo showcasing the key features and capabilities of the AI software solution. Demonstrated how it could be integrated into Account' existing systems to enhance their operations. 30/01/2023- Addressed questions and concerns that arose after the product demo. Clarified technical aspects, integration requirements, and potential ROI that Account could expect. 07/02/2023- Presented a tailored proposal outlining the AI software solution, its benefits, and how it aligns with Account' needs. Discussed pricing options and potential implementation timelines. 14/02/2023- Customer mentioned that they are likely to go to RFP to around 5 solutions and that the RFP will be released over the next 3 weeks latest by 28th Feb 2023. I am working with the internal RFP team to assist with providing the client with an RFP template to send to the client. 21/02/2023- Sent the client the RFP template - discovered that two of the competitors are Humantics AI and FairSale. The client has not committed to using our template - still awaiting the RFP document from the client. 28/02/2023- RFP document is delayed and project stalled for a couple of weeks due to internal priorities of the stakeholder team. 07/03/2023- RFP document released. It is the customer's own template; however, I do see some similarity in many of the points in the document with our template. I suspect that they have utilized some of what I sent to them. RFP response is due in 2 weeks from now, 21st March 2023. 14/03/2023- Completing RFP documentation - still awaiting feedback from Product Marketing on our roadmap and what can be released to the customer as part of the response.

Working internally with the solution consulting team to prepare the demo environment. 30/03/2023- Spoken with my main champion there, Geoff Gables, VP Sales - he stated that they are currently in the process of securing budget internally - apparently, there are a few rounds of approval and the final approval meeting happens on the 21st April 2023. I asked what level of budget that they are looking to secure and they stated enough to cover the requirements of the solution - wouldn't give an exact figure. 14/04/2023- Demo session went very well - a 4-hour-long session; all stakeholders, including Economic Buyer Jim Jackson, Head of Operations, in attendance. We covered all of their main points - a few questions came up on service delivery and SOW; the next step is to build out the SOW. I proposed a Value Engineering session to build out a Proof of Value document - they accepted. Agreed to kick off the value engineering session on 21st April. 21/04/2023- Completed value engineering call, and we will have the POV document with them by the end of the week. 27/04/2023- Delivered Value Engineering POV. 27/04/2023 - Deliverd Value engineering POV. 28/04/2023- Started work on the SOW internally aiming to deliver the SOW with the final implementation program by 5th May 2023. 05/05/2023- Delivered SOW to the client - total services 195K. 07/05/2023- SOW call with the customer to discuss the timeline and project plan in more detail. 10/05/2023- Called my Champion, Geoff Gables, and asked him when the target date is for announcing VOC - he stated by the end of next week. 17/05/2023- We have been awarded VOC and have now moved into discussions with Procurement.

They suggested that the sales process is too intricate and requires streamlining, in addition to an increase in the average deal size. Their goal is to improve customer success rates, allowing them to better service their current clients and safeguard their renewal rates. For their early stage lead generation, they utilize Salesforce, Gong.io, and Outreach. Gave the nod to proceed with a demonstration of the solution. They are dealing with a multitude of inconsistent sales systems. Aiming to offer a unified, seamless platform where most tasks can be performed within a single application. 17/12/2022- Dispatched the NDA for signing. 20/12/2022- I'm yet to receive the returned NDA.

He was asked to pinpoint and notify us about the demonstration attendees. 07/01/2023- The demonstration session proceeded smoothly. They expressed their satisfaction with the UI/UX, yet they stressed the need to confirm if we can integrate with their entire tech stack, including Gong. We need to arrange a conference call between their team and our product management team to assure them that the task of integration can be effectively carried out. In addition, there was some concern around data privacy which they need their Data Privacy team to look into. I've requested that they share their DPA with us, hopefully by the end of this week. 14/01/2023- Topics Covered: Carried out a detailed needs analysis with Account, examining specific aspects they struggle with. Explored how the AI software solution could rectify these issues effectively. 21/01/2023- Convened an assembly focused on deliberating over data privacy and security concerns surrounding our AI software solution.

Also, conversed on pricing structures and possible execution schedules. 14/02/2023- The client noted they're considering sending RFPs to about five solutions and plan to release the RFP within the upcoming three weeks at the latest, by February 28th, 2023. I am collaborating with the internal RFP team to furnish a suitable RFP template for the client to use. 21/02/2023- Dispatched the RFP template to the client, and found out that our competitors are Humantics AI and FairSale. We're still waiting for the client's commitment to use our template and return the RFP document to us. 28/02/2023- The stakeholder team's internal priorities have caused a delay in the RFP document and stalled the project for several weeks. 07/03/2023- The RFP document has been issued, and it appears to be the customer's own template. However, I have noticed a number of similarities to our own template. I suspect that they incorporated some aspects from what I sent them. As per the schedule, the RFP response is due on 21st March 2023, which is around two weeks from today. 14/03/2023- We are still awaiting feedback from our Product Marketing team regarding our road map—information required for completing the RFP documentation. Also, our data privacy team is yet to complete the DPA section of the RFP. 20/03/2023- This morning, I submitted a RFP response that included a quote of $350K per year for licenses and $200K for implementation. 25/03/2023- An appointment has been scheduled by the client, and invitations have been dispatched for a Q&A regarding our feedback - all principal stakeholders from the BA side are expected to attend. 27/03/2023- Our Q and A session was highly successful; we addressed all their concerns. Additionally, I suggested conducting a bespoke Post RFP workshop so we could walk them through a configured demo that encapsulates all their use cases. 28/03/2023-  The customer has requested that we conduct the workshop on 14th April. We are collaborating internally with the solution consulting group to ready the demo environment. 30/03/2023- In a conversation with Geoff Gables, the VP Sales and my primary contact, he mentioned that they are still securing their internal budget. They are going through several rounds of approval and the final one is slated for 21st April 2023. When asked about the budget they're trying to secure, Geoff didn't provide an exact figure but specified it would be enough to meet the solution's requirements. 14/04/2023- The demo session was a great success - with a duration of 4 hours, all stakeholders, including our Economic Buyer Jim Jackson, the Head of Operations, were present. We discussed all their major issues and answered queries related to service delivery and SOW. The next step is to finalize the SOW. I put forth the idea of a Value Engineering session to create a Proof of Value document, which they accepted. We've agreed to initiate the Value Engineering Session on April 21st. 21/04/2023- We successfully concluded the value engineering call and plan to provide them with the POV document by the conclusion of week. 27/04/2023 - Presented a point of view on value engineering. 28/04/2023- Initiated in-house work on the SOW, with a goal to complete the SOW and its final implementation program by May 5th, 2023. 05/05/2023- The SOW was delivered to the client with total services amounting to 195K. 07/05/2023- Call with the client to elaborate on the timeline and project plan in a SOW meeting. 10/05/2023- I spoke with my Champion, Geoff Gables, and inquired about the VOC announcement's intended date - he confirmed it should be by the end of next week. 17/05/2023- Having received the VOC award, we've now transitioned to engaging in discussions with Procurement. Our initial meeting with them is scheduled for the following week. 25/05/2023- In a conversation with the procurement department, they mentioned we have to decrease our pricing throughout all our products to progress. 26/05/2023- In consultation with internal management, it was agreed to provide a 5% additional discount if the deal is closed by the end of June. This comes after our RFP price was earlier marked down by 20% from the list price. 27/05/2023- In today's meeting with both the EC and the champion, we discussed creating a Mutual Activity Plan for closing all outstanding items. 27/05/2023- Today, send the Order form and the MSA to the client so their legal team can process the terms. 29/05/2023- The meet-up with the legal team and our own law professionals is set for 7/06/2023. 30/05/2023- During a conversation with the EB, he suggested including a termination for convenience clause. However, I expressed our inability to do so due to our revenue recognition requirements and instead, offered to include a termination for cause clause. 07/06/2023- The initial legal discussion concerning their contract points proceeded smoothly, though there are still some unresolved issues about Termination for convenience and Support terms. 09/06/2023- We dealt with the clients' redlines and gave back the contract. 10/06/2023- Today, I created the MAP and forwarded the template to the client for their perusal. 15/06/2023- Today, Legal confirmed their satisfaction with the MSA and will forward it for procurement to initiate the signing process. 20/06/2023- I found out today that the authorized signatory is away until the 4th of July. I reminded them that our price remains the same until the end of June, and we need to identify a substitute signatory. 26/06/2023- Ian Harper, the COO, has been identified as the back-up signatory and the contract is in for his signature. 30/06/2023- Today, the contract has been signed and expected to receive the order form by tomorrow, though it would be dated June 30th - last minute modifications on a few minor terms have been made by our Sales Ops. 01/07/2023- The deal is finalized - order form has been signed and purchase order obtained.``` Based on the information given in triple quotes, What all are the specific actions that helped resolving customer pain points?"}, {"role": "assistant","content":"Efficient discovery session.

They highlighted that the sales system is quite complex and needs simplification, and there is also a necessity to raise the average transaction size. They aspire to enhance the success rates of their customers to better serve their existing clients and uphold their renewal rates. They employ Salesforce and Gong.io, in addition to Outreach, for the initial stages of lead generation. Decided to pursue a demonstration of the proposed solution. The number of uncoordinated sales systems they have is overwhelming. We aim to provide a seamless, integrated platform experience that will let users handle most of their work in one application. 17/12/2022- The NDA has been sent for signature. 20/12/2022- I am still waiting for the NDA to be returned.

Ken received an email to specify and give us information about those who will be attending the session. 07/01/2023- Everything went well in the demo session. While they appreciated the UI/UX, they declared that integration with their tech stack including Gong must be guaranteed. It's necessary to schedule a call with their team and our product management group to instill confidence that this integration project is feasible. In addition, there was some concern around data privacy which they need their Data Privacy team to look into.  I've urged them to transmit their DPA to us, potentially by the week's end. 14/01/2023- Key Takeaways: Undertook a thorough needs assessment involving Account. Identifying specific difficulties and obstacles they encounter. Talked about how the implementation of AI software solution could tackle these problems successfully. 21/01/2023- Had a conference where the key topic was data protection and security implications of our AI software solution. We also reviewed its compliance with the data protection needs of Account. 22/01/2023- Carried out a demonstration of a new AI software solution, highlighting its primary features and functions. Presented its potential integration into Account' current operations to improve processes. 30/01/2023- Addressed all inquiries and difficulties that cropped up after the product presentation.

Their plan is to have the RFP sent out within the next three weeks, no later than February 28th, 2023. I am liaising with our internal RFP team to prepare a proper template for the client. 21/02/2023- The client received our RFP template, but we discovered our competition includes Humantics AI and FairSale. The client hasn't confirmed they'll use our template, and is yet to provide the RFP document. 28/02/2023- Due to the internal priorities of the stakeholder team, the project has been delayed for a couple of weeks, and so has the RFP document. 07/03/2023- We have received the RFP document which seems to be based on the customer's personal template. Interestingly, it contains several points that coincide with our template. It makes me think that they have used parts of the data I shared with them. And just to update you, the deadline to respond to the RFP is the 21st March 2023, two weeks from today. 14/03/2023- The RFP documentation is still in the process of being completed while we await feedback from Product Marketing about what components can be included in the customer response. Additionally, we are waiting for the data privacy team to finalize the DPA section of the RFP. 20/03/2023- I finalized and submitted our RFP response today, proposing an annual rate of $350K for licenses and an implementation fee of $200K. 25/03/2023-  A meeting has been established, and the client sent out invites for a Q&A on our response - all essential BA side stakeholders must attend. 27/03/2023- The Q and A session unfolded favorably and we responded to every point they had. Furthermore, I recommended that we orchestrate a customized Post RFP workshop to show them a purpose-built demo, addressing all of their use scenarios. 28/03/2023- On 14th April, as per the customer's request, we are to run a workshop. Our solution consulting team is in the process of preparing the demo environment internally. 30/03/2023- The conversation I had with my key champion, Geoff Gables who is the VP Sales, revolved around their current internal budgeting process. It appears there are several approval stages with the final approval set for 21st April 2023. They couldn't provide an exact budget but stated it would suffice to cover the solution's requirements. 14/04/2023- Our 4-hour demo session was very productive with all stakeholders present, including Jim Jackson, the Economic Buyer and Head of Operations. We addressed all the key points they raised, along with some questions about service delivery and the Statement of Work (SOW). We agreed on my proposal to develop a value engineering session to formulate a Proof of Value document. The session is scheduled to begin on April 21st. 21/04/2023- The value engineering call has been completed and we must have the POV document with them by the termination of week. 27/04/2023 - Conveyed a perspective about value engineering. 28/04/2023- Commenced internal work on the SOW, targeting to finalize with the implementation program on 5th May 2023. 05/05/2023- The client received the SOW, the cost of all services amounted to 195K. 07/05/2023- SOW call scheduled with the customer to delve deeper into the specifics of the timeline and project plan.  10/05/2023- My Champion, Geoff Gables, was contacted by me, and he stated that the target date for the VOC announcement will be by the end of the coming week.  17/05/2023- We are pleased to announce that we've been awarded the VOC, and have subsequently begun consultations with Procurement. The inaugural contact with Procurement will take place in the coming week. 25/05/2023- We just had a discussion with procurement and they informed us that price reduction across all areas is necessary for any advancement. 26/05/2023- After conferring with our internal management, we've decided to grant an extra 5% discount on the already 20%-reduced RFP price, but on the condition that the deal closes by the end of June. 27/05/2023- Constructing a Mutual Activity Plan was the main topic discussed in the meeting with the EC and the champion today, that is intended to help us resolve all outstanding items. 27/05/2023- The MSA and Order form should be sent to the client today for their legal team's processing of the terms. 29/05/2023- Both our legal team and the additional Legal team are planned to meet on 7/06/2023. 30/05/2023- When the EB and I spoke, he insisted on a termination clause for convenience. Despite this proposal, I told him it was impossible due to our revenue recognition prerequisites, but agreed to a termination clause for cause. 07/06/2023- Our first official call to talk through their points on contract was successful. However, we still have some outstanding issues regarding Termination for convenience and Support terms. 09/06/2023- The clients' redlines were addressed by us, and we returned the contract. 10/06/2023- The MAP was put together by me today, then the template was submitted to the client for their check. 15/06/2023- Legal disclosed today that they are pleased with the MSA and will deliver it to procurement for streamlining the signature process. 20/06/2023- Today I learned that the signatory is on holiday until July 4th. I emphasized again that our quote remains stable until the end of June and we are in need of a contingency signatory. 26/06/2023- The back-up signatory, Ian Harper who is COO, has accepted and is expected to sign the contract. 30/06/2023- The contract was signed today and we anticipate the order form to arrive tomorrow, yet it would bear the date of June 30th - our Sales Operations team is adjusting some minor terms that emerged in the final moments. 01/07/2023- Purchase order received and order form inked, hence the deal is sealed.``` Based on the information given in triple quotes, What all are the specific actions that helped resolving customer pain points?"}, {"role": "assistant","content":"Excellent exploration meeting.

They pointed out that the sales operation is excessively detailed, needing streamlining, and an increase in the average deal size is also necessary. They aim to strengthen their services for existing clients by improving their customer success rates, which would also help maintain their renewal rates. Their early stage lead generation involves the use of Salesforce, Gong.io, and Outreach. Concurred to advance with showing a solution demo. They suffer from having too many unconnected sales systems. Our goal is to provide a smooth and combined platform experience where the user can accomplish much of the work in one program. 17/12/2022- Delivered the NDA for endorsement. 20/12/2022- I've yet to get a returned NDA. Moreover, I emailed Jim Jackson, the chief of operations, to present myself and Dealstream, contemplating his possible participation in our planned demo session. 23/12/2022- Reached out to stakeholders via email to lobby for the NDA and to propose optimal dates/times for the demonstration. 01/01/2023- Ken was tasked, through an email, with identifying and informing us about the attendees for the demonstration session, scheduled for the 7th January 2023 following the return of the NDA. 07/01/2023- The demo session was successful. They communicated their admiration for the UI/UX, but also emphasized the importance of a successful integration with their entire tech stack, particularly Gong. We must set a meeting with their team and our product management department to reassure them that we're capable of carrying out this integration task. In addition, there was some concern around data privacy which they need their Data Privacy team to look into. I have implored them to dispatch their DPA to us, ideally before the end of the week. 14/01/2023- Points of Discussion: Conducted a broad-based needs evaluation with Account. Discussed in detail the particular issues and struggles they deal with. Examined how an AI software solution could potentially solve these issues. 21/01/2023- Organized a discussion forum to go over issues concerning data privacy and security of the AI software solution. We also clarified how the solution fulfills Account' data safety protocols. 22/01/2023- Organized a product demonstration to showcase the distinguishing features of our AI software solution. Explained its possible integration within Account' existing systems to optimize their workflows and operations. 30/01/2023- Responded to questions and resolved issues that appeared following the product demo.

Pricing options and likely implementation timelines were also discussed. 14/02/2023-  It was suggested by the customer they are planning to submit RFPs to around five solutions. It’s expected to be released over the coming three weeks, but not later than 28th Feb 2023. I'm teaming up with our in-house RFP department to create an RFP template for the client. 21/02/2023- Found out that Humantics AI and FairSale are our competitors after sending the client our RFP template. We haven't heard from them regarding their commitment to our template and we're waiting for them to return the RFP document. 28/02/2023- The project, as well as the RFP document, has been put on hold for a couple of weeks due to the internal priorities of the stakeholder team. 07/03/2023-  I've noticed that the released RFP document, even though based on the customer's own template, shares a number of similarities with ours. They may have included some aspects from the material I previously sent them. Just so it's clear, the deadline for our RFP response is 21st March 2023, which is two weeks from now. 14/03/2023-  A delay in finalizing the RFP documentation is due to us waiting for input from Product Marketing, particularly about our road map and customer-relevant details. Also, the DPA section of the RFP is still to be concluded by our data privacy department. 20/03/2023- As of this morning, our RFP response was submitted, projecting an annual licensing fee of $350K and an implementation cost of $200K. 25/03/2023- A session has been arranged by the client who also sent invites for a Q and A about our response - attendance from all critical stakeholders on the BA side is mandatory. 27/03/2023- The Q and A session went quite positively. We covered each of their queries comprehensively and I put forward the idea of a tailored Post RFP workshop to guide them through a structured demo which mirrors all their operational cases. 28/03/2023- In alignment with the customer's request, we're scheduled to deliver a workshop on the 14th of April. Our solution consulting team is working behind-the-scenes to set up the demo environment. 30/03/2023- Geoff Gables, the VP Sales, and my main contact therein confirmed they're in the midst of appraising their internal budget, which involves multiple approval steps. Their final approval conference is on 21st April 2023. Also, when questioned about the budget they are aiming to get, they indicated it would be adequate to fund the solution's requirements without disclosing the exact number. 14/04/2023- The 4-hour long demo session proceeded exceedingly well with key stakeholders such as Jim Jackson, the Economic Buyer and Head of Operations present. All the main assigned topics, many questions about service delivery as well as the SOW were addressed. The follow-up action is to construct the SOW. I suggested organizing a Value Engineering session to draft a proof of Value document, and they were in agreement. We decided to commence the Value Engineering Session on 21st April. 21/04/2023- We finished our value engineering call, and the POV document will be with them by week's end of the week. 27/04/2023 - Expressed an opinion about value engineering. 28/04/2023- Began working on the SOW in-house with an objective to wrap up with the finalized implementation program by 5th May 2023. 05/05/2023- Total services of 195K were included in the SOW delivered to the client. 07/05/2023- SOW meeting with the customer set to discuss project plan and timeline in greater detail. 10/05/2023- I asked Geoff Gables, my Champion, about our target timeline for announcing VOC – he let me know it should be by the close of next week. 17/05/2023- Next week, we'll have our first call with Procurement, which comes as a result of us being awarded VOC and initiating a dialogue with them. 25/05/2023- The procurement team has communicated in a recent call that for any forward movement, there's a need to lower our prices on a broad scale. 26/05/2023- Our meeting with the internal management resulted in an agreement to slash prices by an additional 5%. It's important to note that this is supplementary to the 20% reduction from the list price on our RFP and it applies only to deals sealed by June end. 27/05/2023- Today's meeting with the EC and the champion addressed the need to build a Mutual Activity Plan for completing any outstanding items. 27/05/2023- To initiate the process of the terms through the client's legal team, please send the Order form and MSA today. 29/05/2023- An appointment with both the Legal department and our legal squad has been arranged for 7/06/2023. 30/05/2023- The EB and I discussed a termination clause for convenience, and though he suggested it, I clarified that our revenue recognition requirements prevent it but agreed to add a termination for cause clause. 07/06/2023- The preliminary legal meeting to communicate their views on the contract was promising. Nonetheless, we still need to clarify some questions on Termination for convenience and Support terms. 09/06/2023- Having addressed the redlines from the clients, we sent back the contract. 10/06/2023- I've assembled the MAP today and dispatched the template for the client's examination. 15/06/2023- It was confirmed by Legal today that the MSA meets their needs and they will pass it to procurement for the process of signature. 20/06/2023- I discovered today that the signatory will be off until July 4th. I reasserted that our pricing is valid until the end of June, and we need an alternative signatory. 26/06/2023- The back-up signing authority has been recognized as Ian Harper, the COO, and the contract is now in for his signature. 30/06/2023- We signed the contract today, and the order form is likely to appear tomorrow, despite bearing a date of June 30th - due to last minute issues, a few minor adjustments have been made by our Sales Ops. 01/07/2023- Deal completion confirmed - Order form sanctioned and purchase order attained.``` Based on the information given in triple quotes, What all are the specific actions that helped resolving customer pain points?"}, {"role": "assistant","content":"Productive discovery session.

Regarding their criticisms, they mentioned that the sales process appears convoluted and thus needs optimization, furthermore the average deal size needs expansion. They're striving to upgrade their service for existing clients by enhancing the customer success rates and, in turn, securing their renewal rates. Salesforce, Gong.io, and Outreach are the platforms they use for early stage lead generation. Consented to proceed with the solution's practical demonstration. The plethora of inconsistent sales systems they have at their disposal is too much. We seek to offer a single-stop platform that enables the user to perform the lion's share of their work. 17/12/2022- Transmitted the NDA for approval. 20/12/2022- I'm currently waiting for the NDA to be returned. I also decided to introduce myself and Dealstream to Jim Jackson, the head of operations, with a thought of including him in the demo session we are planning.  23/12/2022- Emailed stakeholders to advance the NDA and suggest ideal demonstration times. 01/01/2023- After the NDA returned, we settled on the 7th January, 2023 as the appropriate date for the demonstration. An email was sent to Ken for the purpose of determining and keeping us posted about the session attendees. 07/01/2023- We accomplished a lot in the demo session. They made clear their love for the UI/UX while also stressing that integrating with their full tech stack, especially Gong, is a prerequisite. A call has to be set between our product management squad and their team, so as to convince them about the possibility of the integration work. In addition, there was some concern around data privacy which they need their Data Privacy team to look into. They've been asked by me to forward their DPA to us, hopefully before this week concludes. 14/01/2023- Agenda Items: A holistic needs review was performed in collaboration with Account, with a specific focus on their unique challenges. Delved into how incorporating an AI software solution could confidently alleviate these challenges. 21/01/2023- Undertook a meeting for the purpose of discussing data safety and confidentiality concerns tied to the use of our AI software solution. We also conversed about the solution's adherence to Account' data safeguarding rules. 22/01/2023- Facilitated a product demo, presenting the unique features of an AI software solution. Illustrated its potential for integration with Account' current systems, thereby amplifying the efficiency of their operations. 30/01/2023- Handled questions and worries that presented themselves after demonstrating the product. Explained technical characteristics, integration necessities, and the likely return on investment for Account. 07/02/2023- Showcased a made-to-order proposal laying out the AI software solution, its valuable aspects, and how it meets with the needs of Account. Talked about various pricing models and probable roll-out timelines. 14/02/2023- The customer specified plans to dispatch RFPs to an estimated five solutions, intending to release the RFP within a maximum of three weeks, by 28th Feb 2023. Currently, I'm cooperating with our internal RFP crew to supply the client with a suitable RFP model for his use. 21/02/2023- The RFP template has been given to the client, while we've found out that companies we're competing with are Humantics AI and FairSale. The client remains non-committal to using our template - the awaited RFP document is still in the pipeline. 28/02/2023- The prioritization of internal matters within the stakeholder team has resulted in a delay of the project and the RFP document for a couple of weeks. 07/03/2023- The RFP document, which seems to adopt the customer's personal template, has been made available. Yet, its resemblance to many aspects of our own template is quite noticeable, leading me to suspect that components from what I previously sent were fused into it. For your information, the deadline for our RFP response is set for two weeks from today, precisely on the 21st of March 2023. 14/03/2023- We have yet to complete RFP documentation as we are waiting on feedback from Product Marketing about our road map and related information. We are also awaiting completion of the DPA section of the RFP by our data privacy specialists. 20/03/2023- Finished compiling our RFP response and sent it in today, with an annual license fee of $350K and $200K for implementation. 25/03/2023- Invitations have been dispatched by the client for a planned session that includes a Q and A about our feedback – all important stakeholders from BA should be present. 27/03/2023- Our question and answer session was remarkably successful, as we addressed all of their points. I also proposed a specialized Post RFP workshop where we would take them through a demo configured for their unique use cases. 28/03/2023- The customer requested that we organize the workshop on the 14th of April. We're teaming up with the solution consulting department internally to get the demo environment ready. 30/03/2023- Geoff Gables, Sales VP and my primary champion, indicated they're in the process of internally securing budget, which seems to be in a few stages of approval with the final segment due on 21st April 2023. He didn't disclose a specific figure when I inquired about the level of budget they were targeting, but conveyed it would be enough to meet solution needs. 14/04/2023-  A four-hour demo session turned out to be very effective with all stakeholders in attendance, including Economic Buyer Jim Jackson, the Head of Operations. We managed to cover their main concerns, with a few queries arising about service delivery and SOW. To build out the SOW is our next move. I offered to set up a Value Engineering session to generate a Proof of Value document, to which they consented. We consented to launch the Value Engineering Session on April 21st. 21/04/2023- Our value engineering call is complete and we'll make sure they have the POV document by the close of week. 27/04/2023 - Delivered a standpoint on value engineering. 28/04/2023- Kick-started the work on the SOW internally, with plans to present the final implementation program by the 5th of May, 2023. 05/05/2023- Handed over the SOW to the client with total services costing 195K. 07/05/2023- An in-depth discussion planned for the SOW call with the customer about the project timeline and plan. 10/05/2023- Got into contact with my Champion Geoff Gables and questioned when the VOC is scheduled to be declared - he declared it would be by next week's end.  17/05/2023- VOC recognition has been bestowed upon us, and we've moved forward to discussions involving Procurement. We're slated to have our primary call with them in the week ahead. 25/05/2023- Procurement recommended during our call to consider slashing our prices across the entire range if we want to make progress. 26/05/2023- An understanding was reached with the internal management to provide a further 5% discount on the RFP price that was previously decreased by 20%. However, this offer stands only if the transaction concludes by the end of June. 27/05/2023- To close all outstanding items, the EC, the champion, and I met today to talk about constructing a Mutual Activity Plan. 27/05/2023- Dispatch the Order form along with the MSA to the client today, enabling their legal team to process the terms. 29/05/2023- The congregation with the Legal team and our attorneys has been programmed for 7/06/2023. 30/05/2023- During my discussion with the EB, he proposed a termination for convenience clause. I reminded him of our revenue recognition requirements and suggested a termination for cause clause instead. 07/06/2023- Our initial legal discussion about their contract points went well, with some outstanding queries about Termination for convenience and Support terms still to be discussed. 09/06/2023- We responded to the clients' redlines and handed back the contract. 10/06/2023- Today, the MAP has been fabricated by me, and the client was sent a template for reviewing. 15/06/2023- Today, Legal announced their contentment with the MSA and their intention to give it to procurement for furthering the signature procedure. 20/06/2023- Today, it came to my knowledge that the person who signs is on leave until 4th July. I restated that our price is secured until the end of June and another signatory is necessary. 26/06/2023- Identified Ian Harper, the COO, as the back-up signatory and prepared the contract for his signature. 30/06/2023- Today, a contract was signed, an order form is expected tomorrow but the date will still reflect 30th June - our Sales Operations team are tweaking a few minor terms that were brought up at the ultimate moment. 01/07/2023- A secured deal, as the order form has been signed and the purchase order has been accepted.``` Based on the information given in triple quotes, What all are the specific actions that helped resolving customer pain points?"}, {"role": "assistant","content":"Effective information gathering meeting.

They signaled that they were impressed by the UI/ UX, yet stipulated that they need to ensure the compatibility with their comprehensive tech stack including Gong. There is a need to orchestrate a communication with their team and ours specifically from product management, to let them know this integration job can be completed. In addition, there was some concern around data privacy which they need their Data Privacy team to look into. I've asked them to send over their DPA, and with luck, it should arrive by the end of the week. 14/01/2023- Discussed Details: Conducted a thorough needs analysis for Account, while zeroing in on specific problems they grapple with. Explored how an effective solution could be the deployment of a cutting-edge AI software. 21/01/2023- Arranged a gathering to talk through the data security and privacy matters related to our AI software solution. We also examined the solution's conformity to Account' data protection laws. 22/01/2023- Arranged a product demonstration to highlight the major features of our AI software solution.

The RFP should be out anytime within the next three weeks, not exceeding 28th Feb 2023. I am in collaboration with our RFP team internally to deliver a well-crafted RFP template for the client. 21/02/2023- Given our competitors are Humantics AI and FairSale, the client was sent the RFP template. While we still wait for the commitment from the client to use our template, the RFP document is also yet to be received. 28/02/2023- Owing to the internal priorities of the stakeholder team, there's a delay in the RFP document and a two-week pause in the project. 07/03/2023- An RFP document has just been unveiled, and it seems to have been created from the customer's own template. Despite this, I'm seeing quite a few similarities with our own model, suggesting that they might have used some sections from the information I passed on. It's also important to note that we have to submit our response to the RFP proposal by the 21st of March 2023, exactly two weeks from today. 14/03/2023- Feedback from Product Marketing concerning our road map is still pending, therefore the completion of RFP documentation is on hold. The RFP's DPA section is also awaiting completion by our data privacy team. 20/03/2023- Earlier today, we submitted our RFP response which included annual licenses expenses of 350K USD and implementation costs at 200K. 25/03/2023- A discussion session is established, and invitations have been sent out by the client concerning a Q and A on our response - the presence of all major stakeholders on the BA side is necessary. 27/03/2023- The Q and A session was a resounding success, as we managed to address all their points exhaustively. I suggested offering a personalized Post RFP workshop to help them understand a configured demo representative of all of their use cases. 28/03/2023- We've been tasked by the customer to facilitate a workshop on the 14th of April, and our solution consulting team is working industriously to configure the demo environment internally. 30/03/2023- My main champion, Geoff Gables, who is the VP of Sales, has disclosed they are currently in the process of securing their internal budget. With several rounds of approval, their final sign-off meeting is planned for 21st April 2023. Although he didn't disclose the exact number, he maintained they are looking for a sufficient budget to fulfill the solution's requirements. 14/04/2023- The demo session was a triumph, spanning over 4 hours. All stakeholders were present, including Economic Buyer Jim Jackson, the Head of Operations. We reviewed all the critical points, with a few service delivery and SOW-related queries coming up. The building out of the SOW is the next step. I proposed holding a Value Engineering session to create a Proof of Value document. They concurred, and it was mutually decided to initiate the session on April 21st. 21/04/2023- The value engineering call was a success and we aim to deliver the POV document to them by the close of week. 27/04/2023 - Shared an outlook on value engineering. 28/04/2023- Set the wheels in motion for the internal SOW project, proposing to deliver the SOW and its final implementation program no later than May 5th, 2023. 05/05/2023- Submitted the SOW to the client with a total service cost of 195K. 07/05/2023- Discussing the project timeline and plan in more detail in a SOW call with the customer. 10/05/2023- I contacted Geoff Gables, our Champion, to find out our timeframe for the VOC news - he answered it will be by the culmination of next week.  17/05/2023- Following our recent VOC award, we've ventured into negotiations with Procurement. The first of these discussions will be held during next week's call. 25/05/2023- During our call, the procurement team mentioned the necessity for a comprehensive price reduction to move forward. 26/05/2023- The internal management and I have resolved to extend a 5% discount on the RFP price, which was already lowered by 20%. This extra concession is subject to a closing of the deal by the end of June. 27/05/2023- We had a productive discussion with the EC and the champion today about creating a Mutual Activity Plan to tackle all outstanding issues. 27/05/2023- The client has to receive the Order form and MSA today to allow their legal team the chance to process the terms. 29/05/2023- Our Law team and the Legal team are scheduled to have a discussion on 7/06/2023. 30/05/2023- In my discussion with the EB, he wanted to insert a termination for convenience provision. I mentioned this was not feasible due to our revenue recognition conditions and agreed to include a termination for cause clause. 07/06/2023- The original legal conversation on their positions towards contract was fruitful, but there are still some unsettled points on Termination for convenience and Support terms. 09/06/2023- We took care of the clients' redlines and returned the contract. 10/06/2023- The client was provided with a template today, which I assembled along with the MAP for their inspection. 15/06/2023- The Legal department authenticated today that they agree with the MSA and will pass it on to procurement to move forward with the signing sequence. 20/06/2023- Today, I found out that the signatory will be unavailable until July 4th. I underscored that our pricing maintains until the closing of June, and we ought to find a stand-in signatory. 26/06/2023- We have identified COO Ian Harper as the back-up signatory, and the contract is currently awaiting his signature. 30/06/2023- The contract was successfully signed today while the order form, even though expected tomorrow, will be dated as June 30th - some slight changes are being made by our Sales Ops due to last minute concerns on the order form. 01/07/2023- The order form has been signed off on; the purchase order has been received - Deal sealed.``` Based on the information given in triple quotes, What all are the specific actions that helped resolving customer pain points?"}, {"role": "assistant","content":"Successful understanding session.

It was indicated by them that the sales process was too complicated and needs to be made more efficient, and an increase in average deal size should also be considered. Their objective is to boost service quality for their existing clients by escalating the customer success rates, consequently guarding their renewal rates. They resort to Salesforce, Gong.io and Outreach for the early stages of their lead generation. Approved of moving ahead with a demonstration of the resolution.

We then emailed Ken requesting identification and communication of the session's attendees. 07/01/2023- The demonstration was carried out well in the session. Their fondness for our UI/UX was clear, but they insisted on ensuring the seamless integration with their existing tech stack, with a special mention of Gong. Before starting the integration work, it could be beneficial to hold a discussion with their team and our product management team to alleviate any potential doubts. In addition, there was some concern around data privacy which they need their Data Privacy team to look into. They've been requested to email us their DPA which we're hoping to receive by the week's end. 14/01/2023- Key Discussion Points: Held a detailed needs confrontation with Account, focusing specifically on the pain points and difficulties they face.

My task is to work closely with our internal RFP team to provide an adequate RFP template for the client. 21/02/2023- Dispatched our RFP template to the client, and amidst competition from Humantics AI and FairSale. The client, however, has yet to commit to our template, and we are still waiting for their RFP document. 28/02/2023- Both the RFP document and the project have been delayed for two weeks because of the stakeholder team's internal priorities. 07/03/2023- With the release of the RFP document, I've observed that it's largely grounded on the customer's personal template, but it also bears a lot of resemblances to ours. It's probable they embedded some elements from the content I gave them. Also, the targeted date for the final RFP response is two weeks from now, 21st March 2023. 14/03/2023- Our RFP documentation process is incomplete as we are waiting on our Product Marketing team for feedback regarding our roadmap and customer release information. Similarly, the DPA section is pending completion from our data privacy experts. 20/03/2023- Today, we submitted our RFP response, pricing the licenses at a yearly 350K USD and implementation at 200k. 25/03/2023-  A client-organized session, including a Q and A dealing with our feedback, is scheduled, and invites have been sent – all the key figures on the BA side should participate. 27/03/2023- The Q and A session was conducted smoothly and we were able to answer all their inquiries. I proposed hosting a made-to-order Post RFP workshop to guide them through a demo configured for all their use situations. 28/03/2023- The customer has specified that we hold the workshop on the 14th of April. We're joining forces with the solution consulting team internally to fine-tune the demo environment. 30/03/2023- Speaking with Geoff Gables, my primary champion and the VP of Sales, he explained that they are currently working on securing their budget. This involves a number of approval stages and final approval is expected on the 21st April 2023. He was unsure of the exact figure but assured me it would cover the solution's needs. 14/04/2023- The 4-hour demo session progressed smoothly with all stakeholders, including Economic Buyer Jim Jackson, the Head of Operations actively participating. All their main issues were addressed, along with a few questions on service delivery and SOW. The subsequent step is to develop the SOW. I suggested conducting a Value Engineering session to devise a Proof of Value document.They consented and we slated it for 21st April. 21/04/2023- We’ve accomplished our value engineering call and are planning to have the Pоoint of View (POV) document with them by week end. 27/04/2023 - Offered a perspective on value engineering. 28/04/2023- Embarked on the internal development of the SOW, aiming to conclude it along with the final implementation program by the due date of 5th May 2023. 05/05/2023- The SOW, consisting of services worth 195K, was handed over to the client. 07/05/2023- In a SOW call, conversation with a customer on the subject of a more detailed project plan and timeline. 10/05/2023- Reached out to Geoff Gables, who is my Champion, to question him regarding the VOC revelation's scheduled date - he confirmed it as by the conclusion of the following week. 17/05/2023- New discussion with Procurement has been triggered by our VOC award. The first of this series of conversations is set to kick-off next week. 25/05/2023- After a conversation with the procurement department, it became evident that a general price reduction is required for any further progress. 26/05/2023- Following discussions with the internal management, we concluded to bestow a 5% discount on top of the already reduced 20% off RFP price. This added reduction is specifically tied to a transaction closure by June. 27/05/2023- Both the EC and the champion sat down with me today to brainstorm a Mutual Activity Plan that would allow us to complete all outstanding assignments. 27/05/2023- Forward the MSA and Order form to the client today for the procedure involving their legal team to take effect. 29/05/2023- On 7/06/2023, there's a scheduled meeting with our legal department and the Legal team. 30/05/2023- The EB signaled the need for a termination for convenience clause during our discussion, but I made it clear that this was impracticable due to our revenue recognition standards and agreed to a termination for cause clause instead. 07/06/2023- Our maiden legal call to deliberate on their perspectives on the contract was constructive, yet there are a few outstanding subjects concerning Termination for convenience and Support terms. 09/06/2023-  After addressing the clients' redlines, we were able to return the contract. 10/06/2023- After creating the MAP, I sent the template to the client today for them to look over. 15/06/2023- Legal expressed today their approval of the MSA and will convey it to procurement to expedite the signature process. 20/06/2023- I was made aware today that the person authorized to sign is vacationing until 4th July. I reinstate that our pricing stays intact until June ends, and we must locate a spare signatory. 26/06/2023- Ian Harper, holding the position of COO, has been identified as the back-up signatory and the contract to be signed is with him. 30/06/2023- Our agreement got signed today, with the order form to be received tomorrow but dated for June 30th - some last minute minor shifts by our Sales Operations team have been brought to light.  01/07/2023- With a signed order form and a received purchase order, the deal is completed.``` Based on the information given in triple quotes, What all are the specific actions that helped resolving customer pain points?"}, {"role": "assistant","content":"Valuable discovery session.

They put forth the view that the sales process in place is more complicated than it needs to be and needs streamlining, in addition to an expansion in the average deal size. Their ambition is to provide better service to their existing clients by increasing their success rates, thereby preserving their renewal rates. Their process of early stage lead generation relies on Salesforce, Gong.io, and Outreach. Settled on proceeding with a demonstration for the solution. They are juggling too many unrelated sales systems. Our aim is to create a comprehensive platform experience, enabling the user to undertake most tasks in a singular application. 17/12/2022- Relayed the NDA for certification. 20/12/2022- The NDA hasn't been returned yet and I'm still waiting. Also, I've contacted Jim Jackson, the operations head, via email to introduce myself and Dealstream and explore the possibility of his involvement in our scheduled demo session.  23/12/2022- Communicated via email with stakeholders to expedite the NDA procedure and suggest feasible dates for the demonstration. 01/01/2023- Following the return of the NDA, the 7th January 2023 has been agreed upon as the best date for the demonstration. Furthermore, Ken has been contacted via email to identify and inform us about the expected attendees. 07/01/2023- The demo session proceeded without any hiccups. They expressed their preference for our UI/UX, but the condition was that it would need to integrate seamlessly with their broad tech stack including Gong. Need to establish a networking session with their and our product team to guarantee them that the integration task can be executed. In addition, there was some concern around data privacy which they need their Data Privacy team to look into. I've asked them to share their DPA with us, and they will likely do so by the conclusion of the week. 14/01/2023- Dialogue Summary: Implemented a complete needs analysis involving Account, highlighting and discussing particular issues they have to deal with. Looked into how effective AI software solutions could potentially resolve these challenges. 21/01/2023- Facilitated a session to discuss data safety and privacy implications of the AI software solution in question. We also reviewed its alignment with Account' requisite data protection measures. 22/01/2023- Presented a product demo, pinpointing the chief features and power of our AI software solution. Showed its capability to be merged with Account ' current system, potentially uplifting their operations efficiency. 30/01/2023- Clarified doubts and issues that occurred after the product presentation. Elucidated about the technical details, integration processes and the probable ROI that'll benefit Account. 07/02/2023- Delivered a specialized proposal which observed in detail the AI software solution, its profits, and its harmony to Account' needs. Also, had a dialogue concerning the pricing possibilities and estimated initiation schedules. 14/02/2023- It was stated by the customer that they are inclined to go for RFP with nearly five solutions. The RFP is set to be released no later than the next three weeks or by 28th Feb 2023 to be specific. I am liaising with the internal team in charge of RFP to avail the client with an RFP template to suit their needs. 21/02/2023- We've sent out the RFP template to our client, whilst finding out our competitive field includes Humantics AI and FairSale. The client is yet to decide on using our template, and we're still in the waiting for their RFP document. 28/02/2023- It's the internal priorities of the stakeholder team that have caused a two-week delay in both the project and the RFP document. 07/03/2023- The RFP document that was recently circulated appears to be based mostly on the customer's original template. Yet, it noticeably shares a vast proportion of comparable points with ours, which leads me to believe that they utilized some of the particulars I forwarded to them. Also, the deposition of the RFP response is due in two weeks, dated 21st March 2023. 14/03/2023- The RFP documentation process is not yet completed —we are currently waiting for our Product Marketing team to provide their feedback on our roadmap and the data that can be disclosed to the customer. Our data privacy team is also yet to finish up on the DPA section of the RFP. 20/03/2023- The RFP response that we submitted this morning outlines an annual charge of 350K USD for licenses and 200K for implementation. 25/03/2023- A rendezvous has been scheduled and invites have been sent by the client regarding a Q and A session about our response - all responsible parties from the BA side are required to attend. 27/03/2023- The Q & A session was executed perfectly; we addressed all their issues and I proposed that we instigate a specific Post RFP workshop to exhibit a corresponding demo catering to all of their use cases. 28/03/2023- As requested by the client, the workshop will proceed on the 14th of April. Simultaneously, we're coordinating with our solution consulting team to get the demo environment ready.  30/03/2023- In my recent discussion with my main champion, Geoff Gables who is the VP Sales, he revealed that budget securing process is ongoing. They're undertaking a few rounds of approval which will culminate on 21st April 2023. He was not able to provide a specific number for the budget they are trying to secure but assured it would be enough to cater to the solution requirements. 14/04/2023-  A successful demo session lasted for 4 hours with all key stakeholders including Economic Buyer, Jim Jackson and the Head of Operations gracing the event. We managed to cover all their principal concerns, with a few queries around service delivery and SOW popping up. The next phase involves building out the SOW. I put forth a suggestion to hold a Value Engineering session to design a Proof of Value document, which they agreed to. The session is set to kick off on 21st April. 21/04/2023- Having completed the value engineering call, we commit to having the POV document with them before the conclusion of week. 27/04/2023 - Language about value engineering has been provided. 28/04/2023- We've begun in-house work on the SOW, with a timeline to deliver the completed SOW and its implementation program by 5th May 2023. 05/05/2023- Provided the client with the SOW, totalling services to 195K. 07/05/2023- Customer planned for SOW call to discuss project plan specifics and detailing the timeline. 10/05/2023- During our conversation, Geoff Gables, the Champion, told me that the VOC announcement is planned for the end of next week. 17/05/2023-  With the VOC award under our belt, we've launched into discussion talks with Procurement. We're anticipating our first call with them to take place next week. 25/05/2023- We've spoken to procurement, who suggested that for us to progress, there needs to be a universal price cut. 26/05/2023- I've interacted with the internal team and a consensus was reached to offer an added 5% discount. This is over and above the 20% reduction we've made before on our RFP price, with a clause of deal closure by end of June attached. 27/05/2023- Together with the EC and the champion, we pondered over constructing a Mutual Activity Plan today, aiming to resolve all outstanding items. 27/05/2023- Have the client's legal team process the terms by sending them the MSA and Order form today. 29/05/2023- The date for the meeting with the external Legal team and our in-house law team is 7/06/2023. 30/05/2023- An interesting conversation with the EB brought up the need for a termination clause for convenience. I highlighted our revenue recognition requirements which rendered this impossible and gave assurance that a termination for cause clause will be instated instead. 07/06/2023- The primary legal dialogue to address their stances on the contract was effective, although we still retain some contentious points around Termination for convenience and Support terms. 09/06/2023- We managed the clients' redlines and sent the contract back. 10/06/2023- Having constructed the MAP, the template was forwarded to the client today for their review. 15/06/2023- Satisfied with the MSA, Legal today will send it over to procurement to facilitate the endorsement process. 20/06/2023- Today's discovery indicated that the individual who will sign is on break until the 4th of July. I repeated that our prices are stable until the end of June, and we need to pinpoint a back up signatory. 26/06/2023- Ian Harper, COO, has been assigned as the back-up signatory and is currently in possession of the contract to sign. 30/06/2023- Today marked the signing of the contract with the order form on its way tomorrow, despite its June 30th dating - there are a few minor alterations on the order form from our Sales Ops team due to unforeseen last-minute issues. 01/07/2023- Deal concluded successfully - thanks to the receipt of the purchase order and the signed order form.``` Based on the information given in triple quotes, What all are the specific actions that helped resolving customer pain points?"}, {"role": "assistant","content":"Insightful exploration session.

They communicated that the sales process is overly detailed and recommended an effort to streamline this, along with increasing the average deal size. They plan to enhance their provision for existing clients by maximizing the customer success rates, which should help safe-guard their renewal rates. The initial phase of their lead generation employs Salesforce, Gong.io, as well as Outreach. Decided to proceed with a solution demonstration.

They affirmed their liking for the UI/UX, yet, held that assurance was required for the integration with their extensive tech suite, including Gong. It is vital to have a dialogue with their team along with our product management to ensure them of the viability of this integration process. In addition, there was some concern around data privacy which they need their Data Privacy team to look into. I've directed them to provide their DPA to us; we should hopefully receive it by the end of this week. 14/01/2023- Session highlights: Undertook a comprehensive needs study engaging Account, reviewing specific hardships they endure.

I am working together with our internal RFP team to create a suitable RFP template to hand over to the client.  21/02/2023- After submitting our RFP template to the client, we discovered they are also considering Humantics AI and FairSale. So far the client has not decided to use our template, and we are still awaiting their RFP document. 28/02/2023- The project and the RFP document are on hold for a couple of weeks due to the internal focus of the stakeholder team. 07/03/2023- The customer’s revised RFP document has been distributed. I can't help but notice that, although it primarily uses their template, there are several similarities with our own. It's possible that they incorporated some of the materials I sent earlier. An important thing to remember is that our response to the RFP is expected by the 21st of March 2023, that is, two weeks from now. 14/03/2023- The RFP documentation is not done yet, owing to the feedback we're expecting from Product Marketing on our strategy and customer-committed elements.

There are a few stages of approval, with the last one scheduled for 21st April 2023. Although unable to give an exact figure, he said they're aiming for a budget large enough to cover all aspects of the needed solution. 14/04/2023- The demo session went splendidly, it spanned over 4 hours, and all key stakeholders were present, including Economic Buyer, Jim Jackson, and the Head of Operations. We covered all their main topics, and a few inquiries arose related to service delivery and SOW. The next crucial move is to establish the SOW. I suggested going in for a Value Engineering session for the creation of a Proof of Value document, and they agreed. We decided to begin this session on April 21st. 21/04/2023- Successfully wrapped up the value engineering call, and we are aiming to have the POV document with them by the week's end. 27/04/2023 - Supplied a viewpoint on the topic of value engineering. 28/04/2023- Made a start on the internal handling of the SOW, setting the goal to finish off with the final implementation program by the 5th May 2023. 05/05/2023- With total services amounting to 195K, the SOW was delivered to the client. 07/05/2023- Planned SOW call, targeting a detailed conversation with the customer about the project plan and timeline. 10/05/2023- Geoff Gables, the Champion I'm working with, informed me upon asking that the VOC disclosure should be by next week's end. 17/05/2023- We've recently been granted the VOC award and have started conversations with Procurement as a result.

We're yet to receive client's confirmation on using our template, and the RFP document is still awaited. 28/02/2023- Internal priorities within the stakeholder team have resulted in a delay of the RFP document and a couple of weeks' hold-up in the project progress. 07/03/2023- We have the released RFP document, which is heavily influenced by the customer's own template. It's noteworthy to mention that a lot of the points parallel ours. This leads me to assume that they have used some concepts from the information I transmitted to them.

They pointed out that the sales operation is excessively detailed, needing streamlining, and an increase in the average deal size is also necessary. They aim to strengthen their services for existing clients by improving their customer success rates, which would also help maintain their renewal rates. Their early stage lead generation involves the use of Salesforce, Gong.io, and Outreach. Concurred to advance with showing a solution demo. They suffer from having too many unconnected sales systems. Our goal is to provide a smooth and combined platform experience where the user can accomplish much of the work in one program. 17/12/2022- Delivered the NDA for endorsement. 20/12/2022- I've yet to get a returned NDA. Moreover, I emailed Jim Jackson, the chief of operations, to present myself and Dealstream, contemplating his possible participation in our planned demo session. 23/12/2022- Reached out to stakeholders via email to lobby for the NDA and to propose optimal dates/times for the demonstration. 01/01/2023- Ken was tasked, through an email, with identifying and informing us about the attendees for the demonstration session, scheduled for the 7th January 2023 following the return of the NDA. 07/01/2023- The demo session was successful. They communicated their admiration for the UI/UX, but also emphasized the importance of a successful integration with their entire tech stack, particularly Gong. We must set a meeting with their team and our product management department to reassure them that we're capable of carrying out this integration task. In addition, there was some concern around data privacy which they need their Data Privacy team to look into. I have implored them to dispatch their DPA to us, ideally before the end of the week. 14/01/2023- Points of Discussion: Conducted a broad-based needs evaluation with Account. Discussed in detail the particular issues and struggles they deal with. Examined how an AI software solution could potentially solve these issues. 21/01/2023- Organized a discussion forum to go over issues concerning data privacy and security of the AI software solution. We also clarified how the solution fulfills Account' data safety protocols. 22/01/2023- Organized a product demonstration to showcase the distinguishing features of our AI software solution. Explained its possible integration within Account' existing systems to optimize their workflows and operations. 30/01/2023- Responded to questions and resolved issues that appeared following the product demo. Provided clarity on technical dimensions, integration demands, and prospective ROI available for Account. 07/02/2023- Provided a bespoke proposal explaining the relevance of the AI software solution, how beneficial it is, and how it matches Account' needs. Pricing options and likely implementation timelines were also discussed. 14/02/2023-  It was suggested by the customer they are planning to submit RFPs to around five solutions. It’s expected to be released over the coming three weeks, but not later than 28th Feb 2023. I'm teaming up with our in-house RFP department to create an RFP template for the client. 21/02/2023- Found out that Humantics AI and FairSale are our competitors after sending the client our RFP template. We haven't heard from them regarding their commitment to our template and we're waiting for them to return the RFP document. 28/02/2023- The project, as well as the RFP document, has been put on hold for a couple of weeks due to the internal priorities of the stakeholder team. 07/03/2023-  I've noticed that the released RFP document, even though based on the customer's own template, shares a number of similarities with ours. They may have included some aspects from the material I previously sent them. Just so it's clear, the deadline for our RFP response is 21st March 2023, which is two weeks from now. 14/03/2023-  A delay in finalizing the RFP documentation is due to us waiting for input from Product Marketing, particularly about our road map and customer-relevant details. Also, the DPA section of the RFP is still to be concluded by our data privacy department. 20/03/2023- As of this morning, our RFP response was submitted, projecting an annual licensing fee of $350K and an implementation cost of $200K. 25/03/2023- A session has been arranged by the client who also sent invites for a Q and A about our response - attendance from all critical stakeholders on the BA side is mandatory. 27/03/2023- The Q and A session went quite positively. We covered each of their queries comprehensively and I put forward the idea of a tailored Post RFP workshop to guide them through a structured demo which mirrors all their operational cases. 28/03/2023- In alignment with the customer's request, we're scheduled to deliver a workshop on the 14th of April. Our solution consulting team is working behind-the-scenes to set up the demo environment. 30/03/2023- Geoff Gables, the VP Sales, and my main contact therein confirmed they're in the midst of appraising their internal budget, which involves multiple approval steps. Their final approval conference is on 21st April 2023. Also, when questioned about the budget they are aiming to get, they indicated it would be adequate to fund the solution's requirements without disclosing the exact number. 14/04/2023- The 4-hour long demo session proceeded exceedingly well with key stakeholders such as Jim Jackson, the Economic Buyer and Head of Operations present. All the main assigned topics, many questions about service delivery as well as the SOW were addressed. The follow-up action is to construct the SOW. I suggested organizing a Value Engineering session to draft a proof of Value document, and they were in agreement. We decided to commence the Value Engineering Session on 21st April. 21/04/2023- We finished our value engineering call, and the POV document will be with them by week's end of the week. 27/04/2023 - Expressed an opinion about value engineering. 28/04/2023- Began working on the SOW in-house with an objective to wrap up with the finalized implementation program by 5th May 2023. 05/05/2023- Total services of 195K were included in the SOW delivered to the client. 07/05/2023- SOW meeting with the customer set to discuss project plan and timeline in greater detail. 10/05/2023- I asked Geoff Gables, my Champion, about our target timeline for announcing VOC – he let me know it should be by the close of next week. 17/05/2023- Next week, we'll have our first call with Procurement, which comes as a result of us being awarded VOC and initiating a dialogue with them. 25/05/2023- The procurement team has communicated in a recent call that for any forward movement, there's a need to lower our prices on a broad scale. 26/05/2023- Our meeting with the internal management resulted in an agreement to slash prices by an additional 5%. It's important to note that this is supplementary to the 20% reduction from the list price on our RFP and it applies only to deals sealed by June end. 27/05/2023- Today's meeting with the EC and the champion addressed the need to build a Mutual Activity Plan for completing any outstanding items. 27/05/2023- To initiate the process of the terms through the client's legal team, please send the Order form and MSA today. 29/05/2023- An appointment with both the Legal department and our legal squad has been arranged for 7/06/2023. 30/05/2023- The EB and I discussed a termination clause for convenience, and though he suggested it, I clarified that our revenue recognition requirements prevent it but agreed to add a termination for cause clause. 07/06/2023- The preliminary legal meeting to communicate their views on the contract was promising. Nonetheless, we still need to clarify some questions on Termination for convenience and Support terms. 09/06/2023- Having addressed the redlines from the clients, we sent back the contract. 10/06/2023- I've assembled the MAP today and dispatched the template for the client's examination. 15/06/2023- It was confirmed by Legal today that the MSA meets their needs and they will pass it to procurement for the process of signature. 20/06/2023- I discovered today that the signatory will be off until July 4th. I reasserted that our pricing is valid until the end of June, and we need an alternative signatory. 26/06/2023- The back-up signing authority has been recognized as Ian Harper, the COO, and the contract is now in for his signature. 30/06/2023- We signed the contract today, and the order form is likely to appear tomorrow, despite bearing a date of June 30th - due to last minute issues, a few minor adjustments have been made by our Sales Ops. 01/07/2023- Deal completion confirmed - Order form sanctioned and purchase order attained.``` Based on the details mentioned in triple quotes, the following sentence describes a problems that the sales agent encountered.

Regarding their criticisms, they mentioned that the sales process appears convoluted and thus needs optimization, furthermore the average deal size needs expansion. They're striving to upgrade their service for existing clients by enhancing the customer success rates and, in turn, securing their renewal rates. Salesforce, Gong.io, and Outreach are the platforms they use for early stage lead generation. Consented to proceed with the solution's practical demonstration. The plethora of inconsistent sales systems they have at their disposal is too much. We seek to offer a single-stop platform that enables the user to perform the lion's share of their work. 17/12/2022- Transmitted the NDA for approval. 20/12/2022- I'm currently waiting for the NDA to be returned. I also decided to introduce myself and Dealstream to Jim Jackson, the head of operations, with a thought of including him in the demo session we are planning.  23/12/2022- Emailed stakeholders to advance the NDA and suggest ideal demonstration times. 01/01/2023- After the NDA returned, we settled on the 7th January, 2023 as the appropriate date for the demonstration.

They made clear their love for the UI/UX while also stressing that integrating with their full tech stack, especially Gong, is a prerequisite. A call has to be set between our product management squad and their team, so as to convince them about the possibility of the integration work. In addition, there was some concern around data privacy which they need their Data Privacy team to look into. They've been asked by me to forward their DPA to us, hopefully before this week concludes. 14/01/2023- Agenda Items: A holistic needs review was performed in collaboration with Account, with a specific focus on their unique challenges. Delved into how incorporating an AI software solution could confidently alleviate these challenges. 21/01/2023- Undertook a meeting for the purpose of discussing data safety and confidentiality concerns tied to the use of our AI software solution.

Talked about various pricing models and probable roll-out timelines. 14/02/2023- The customer specified plans to dispatch RFPs to an estimated five solutions, intending to release the RFP within a maximum of three weeks, by 28th Feb 2023. Currently, I'm cooperating with our internal RFP crew to supply the client with a suitable RFP model for his use. 21/02/2023- The RFP template has been given to the client, while we've found out that companies we're competing with are Humantics AI and FairSale. The client remains non-committal to using our template - the awaited RFP document is still in the pipeline. 28/02/2023- The prioritization of internal matters within the stakeholder team has resulted in a delay of the project and the RFP document for a couple of weeks. 07/03/2023- The RFP document, which seems to adopt the customer's personal template, has been made available. Yet, its resemblance to many aspects of our own template is quite noticeable, leading me to suspect that components from what I previously sent were fused into it. For your information, the deadline for our RFP response is set for two weeks from today, precisely on the 21st of March 2023. 14/03/2023- We have yet to complete RFP documentation as we are waiting on feedback from Product Marketing about our road map and related information.

We're teaming up with the solution consulting department internally to get the demo environment ready. 30/03/2023- Geoff Gables, Sales VP and my primary champion, indicated they're in the process of internally securing budget, which seems to be in a few stages of approval with the final segment due on 21st April 2023. He didn't disclose a specific figure when I inquired about the level of budget they were targeting, but conveyed it would be enough to meet solution needs. 14/04/2023-  A four-hour demo session turned out to be very effective with all stakeholders in attendance, including Economic Buyer Jim Jackson, the Head of Operations. We managed to cover their main concerns, with a few queries arising about service delivery and SOW. To build out the SOW is our next move. I offered to set up a Value Engineering session to generate a Proof of Value document, to which they consented.

We also clarified how the solution fulfills Account' data safety protocols. 22/01/2023- Organized a product demonstration to showcase the distinguishing features of our AI software solution. Explained its possible integration within Account' existing systems to optimize their workflows and operations. 30/01/2023- Responded to questions and resolved issues that appeared following the product demo.

Pricing options and likely implementation timelines were also discussed. 14/02/2023-  It was suggested by the customer they are planning to submit RFPs to around five solutions. It’s expected to be released over the coming three weeks, but not later than 28th Feb 2023. I'm teaming up with our in-house RFP department to create an RFP template for the client. 21/02/2023- Found out that Humantics AI and FairSale are our competitors after sending the client our RFP template. We haven't heard from them regarding their commitment to our template and we're waiting for them to return the RFP document. 28/02/2023- The project, as well as the RFP document, has been put on hold for a couple of weeks due to the internal priorities of the stakeholder team. 07/03/2023-  I've noticed that the released RFP document, even though based on the customer's own template, shares a number of similarities with ours. They may have included some aspects from the material I previously sent them. Just so it's clear, the deadline for our RFP response is 21st March 2023, which is two weeks from now. 14/03/2023-  A delay in finalizing the RFP documentation is due to us waiting for input from Product Marketing, particularly about our road map and customer-relevant details. Also, the DPA section of the RFP is still to be concluded by our data privacy department. 20/03/2023- As of this morning, our RFP response was submitted, projecting an annual licensing fee of $350K and an implementation cost of $200K. 25/03/2023- A session has been arranged by the client who also sent invites for a Q and A about our response - attendance from all critical stakeholders on the BA side is mandatory. 27/03/2023- The Q and A session went quite positively. We covered each of their queries comprehensively and I put forward the idea of a tailored Post RFP workshop to guide them through a structured demo which mirrors all their operational cases. 28/03/2023- In alignment with the customer's request, we're scheduled to deliver a workshop on the 14th of April. Our solution consulting team is working behind-the-scenes to set up the demo environment. 30/03/2023- Geoff Gables, the VP Sales, and my main contact therein confirmed they're in the midst of appraising their internal budget, which involves multiple approval steps. Their final approval conference is on 21st April 2023. Also, when questioned about the budget they are aiming to get, they indicated it would be adequate to fund the solution's requirements without disclosing the exact number. 14/04/2023- The 4-hour long demo session proceeded exceedingly well with key stakeholders such as Jim Jackson, the Economic Buyer and Head of Operations present. All the main assigned topics, many questions about service delivery as well as the SOW were addressed. The follow-up action is to construct the SOW. I suggested organizing a Value Engineering session to draft a proof of Value document, and they were in agreement. We decided to commence the Value Engineering Session on 21st April. 21/04/2023- We finished our value engineering call, and the POV document will be with them by week's end of the week. 27/04/2023 - Expressed an opinion about value engineering. 28/04/2023- Began working on the SOW in-house with an objective to wrap up with the finalized implementation program by 5th May 2023. 05/05/2023- Total services of 195K were included in the SOW delivered to the client. 07/05/2023- SOW meeting with the customer set to discuss project plan and timeline in greater detail. 10/05/2023- I asked Geoff Gables, my Champion, about our target timeline for announcing VOC – he let me know it should be by the close of next week. 17/05/2023- Next week, we'll have our first call with Procurement, which comes as a result of us being awarded VOC and initiating a dialogue with them. 25/05/2023- The procurement team has communicated in a recent call that for any forward movement, there's a need to lower our prices on a broad scale. 26/05/2023- Our meeting with the internal management resulted in an agreement to slash prices by an additional 5%. It's important to note that this is supplementary to the 20% reduction from the list price on our RFP and it applies only to deals sealed by June end. 27/05/2023- Today's meeting with the EC and the champion addressed the need to build a Mutual Activity Plan for completing any outstanding items. 27/05/2023- To initiate the process of the terms through the client's legal team, please send the Order form and MSA today. 29/05/2023- An appointment with both the Legal department and our legal squad has been arranged for 7/06/2023. 30/05/2023- The EB and I discussed a termination clause for convenience, and though he suggested it, I clarified that our revenue recognition requirements prevent it but agreed to add a termination for cause clause. 07/06/2023- The preliminary legal meeting to communicate their views on the contract was promising. Nonetheless, we still need to clarify some questions on Termination for convenience and Support terms. 09/06/2023- Having addressed the redlines from the clients, we sent back the contract. 10/06/2023- I've assembled the MAP today and dispatched the template for the client's examination. 15/06/2023- It was confirmed by Legal today that the MSA meets their needs and they will pass it to procurement for the process of signature. 20/06/2023- I discovered today that the signatory will be off until July 4th. I reasserted that our pricing is valid until the end of June, and we need an alternative signatory. 26/06/2023- The back-up signing authority has been recognized as Ian Harper, the COO, and the contract is now in for his signature. 30/06/2023- We signed the contract today, and the order form is likely to appear tomorrow, despite bearing a date of June 30th - due to last minute issues, a few minor adjustments have been made by our Sales Ops. 01/07/2023- Deal completion confirmed - Order form sanctioned and purchase order attained.``` Based on the details mentioned in triple quotes, the following sentence describes a problem that the sales agent encountered.

Regarding their criticisms, they mentioned that the sales process appears convoluted and thus needs optimization, furthermore the average deal size needs expansion. They're striving to upgrade their service for existing clients by enhancing the customer success rates and, in turn, securing their renewal rates. Salesforce, Gong.io, and Outreach are the platforms they use for early stage lead generation. Consented to proceed with the solution's practical demonstration. The plethora of inconsistent sales systems they have at their disposal is too much. We seek to offer a single-stop platform that enables the user to perform the lion's share of their work. 17/12/2022- Transmitted the NDA for approval. 20/12/2022- I'm currently waiting for the NDA to be returned.

They made clear their love for the UI/UX while also stressing that integrating with their full tech stack, especially Gong, is a prerequisite. A call has to be set between our product management squad and their team, so as to convince them about the possibility of the integration work. In addition, there was some concern around data privacy which they need their Data Privacy team to look into. They've been asked by me to forward their DPA to us, hopefully before this week concludes. 14/01/2023- Agenda Items: A holistic needs review was performed in collaboration with Account, with a specific focus on their unique challenges. Delved into how incorporating an AI software solution could confidently alleviate these challenges. 21/01/2023- Undertook a meeting for the purpose of discussing data safety and confidentiality concerns tied to the use of our AI software solution.

The client remains non-committal to using our template - the awaited RFP document is still in the pipeline. 28/02/2023- The prioritization of internal matters within the stakeholder team has resulted in a delay of the project and the RFP document for a couple of weeks. 07/03/2023- The RFP document, which seems to adopt the customer's personal template, has been made available. Yet, its resemblance to many aspects of our own template is quite noticeable, leading me to suspect that components from what I previously sent were fused into it. For your information, the deadline for our RFP response is set for two weeks from today, precisely on the 21st of March 2023. 14/03/2023- We have yet to complete RFP documentation as we are waiting on feedback from Product Marketing about our road map and related information.

I offered to set up a Value Engineering session to generate a Proof of Value document, to which they consented.

I've asked them to send over their DPA, and with luck, it should arrive by the end of the week. 14/01/2023- Discussed Details: Conducted a thorough needs analysis for Account, while zeroing in on specific problems they grapple with.

I am working with the internal RFP team to assist with providing the client with an RFP template to send to the client. 21/02/2023- Sent the client the RFP template - discovered that two of the competitors are Humantics AI and FairSale. The client has not committed to using our template - still awaiting the RFP document from the client. 28/02/2023- RFP document is delayed and project stalled for a couple of weeks due to internal priorities of the stakeholder team. 07/03/2023- RFP document released.

Working internally with the solution consulting team to prepare the demo environment. 30/03/2023- Spoken with my main champion there, Geoff Gables, VP Sales - he stated that they are currently in the process of securing budget internally - apparently, there are a few rounds of approval and the final approval meeting happens on the 21st April 2023.

We covered all of their main points - a few questions came up on service delivery and SOW; the next step is to build out the SOW. I proposed a Value Engineering session to build out a Proof of Value document - they accepted.

They suggested that the sales process is too intricate and requires streamlining, in addition to an increase in the average deal size. Their goal is to improve customer success rates, allowing them to better service their current clients and safeguard their renewal rates. For their early stage lead generation, they utilize Salesforce, Gong.io, and Outreach. Gave the nod to proceed with a demonstration of the solution. They are dealing with a multitude of inconsistent sales systems. Aiming to offer a unified, seamless platform where most tasks can be performed within a single application. 17/12/2022- Dispatched the NDA for signing. 20/12/2022- I'm yet to receive the returned NDA.

He was asked to pinpoint and notify us about the demonstration attendees. 07/01/2023- The demonstration session proceeded smoothly. They expressed their satisfaction with the UI/UX, yet they stressed the need to confirm if we can integrate with their entire tech stack, including Gong. We need to arrange a conference call between their team and our product management team to assure them that the task of integration can be effectively carried out. In addition, there was some concern around data privacy which they need their Data Privacy team to look into. I've requested that they share their DPA with us, hopefully by the end of this week. 14/01/2023- Topics Covered: Carried out a detailed needs analysis with Account, examining specific aspects they struggle with.

I am collaborating with the internal RFP team to furnish a suitable RFP template for the client to use. 21/02/2023- Dispatched the RFP template to the client, and found out that our competitors are Humantics AI and FairSale. We're still waiting for the client's commitment to use our template and return the RFP document to us. 28/02/2023- The stakeholder team's internal priorities have caused a delay in the RFP document and stalled the project for several weeks. 07/03/2023- The RFP document has been issued, and it appears to be the customer's own template. However, I have noticed a number of similarities to our own template. I suspect that they incorporated some aspects from what I sent them. As per the schedule, the RFP response is due on 21st March 2023, which is around two weeks from today. 14/03/2023- We are still awaiting feedback from our Product Marketing team regarding our road map—information required for completing the RFP documentation. Also, our data privacy team is yet to complete the DPA section of the RFP. 20/03/2023- This morning, I submitted a RFP response that included a quote of $350K per year for licenses and $200K for implementation. 25/03/2023- An appointment has been scheduled by the client, and invitations have been dispatched for a Q&A regarding our feedback - all principal stakeholders from the BA side are expected to attend. 27/03/2023- Our Q and A session was highly successful; we addressed all their concerns.

We are collaborating internally with the solution consulting group to ready the demo environment. 30/03/2023- In a conversation with Geoff Gables, the VP Sales and my primary contact, he mentioned that they are still securing their internal budget. They are going through several rounds of approval and the final one is slated for 21st April 2023. When asked about the budget they're trying to secure, Geoff didn't provide an exact figure but specified it would be enough to meet the solution's requirements. 14/04/2023- The demo session was a great success - with a duration of 4 hours, all stakeholders, including our Economic Buyer Jim Jackson, the Head of Operations, were present. We discussed all their major issues and answered queries related to service delivery and SOW. The next step is to finalize the SOW. I put forth the idea of a Value Engineering session to create a Proof of Value document, which they accepted.

This comes after our RFP price was earlier marked down by 20% from the list price. 27/05/2023- In today's meeting with both the EC and the champion, we discussed creating a Mutual Activity Plan for closing all outstanding items. 27/05/2023- Today, send the Order form and the MSA to the client so their legal team can process the terms. 29/05/2023- The meet-up with the legal team and our own law professionals is set for 7/06/2023. 30/05/2023- During a conversation with the EB, he suggested including a termination for convenience clause. However, I expressed our inability to do so due to our revenue recognition requirements and instead, offered to include a termination for cause clause. 07/06/2023- The initial legal discussion concerning their contract points proceeded smoothly, though there are still some unresolved issues about Termination for convenience and Support terms. 09/06/2023- We dealt with the clients' redlines and gave back the contract. 10/06/2023- Today, I created the MAP and forwarded the template to the client for their perusal. 15/06/2023- Today, Legal confirmed their satisfaction with the MSA and will forward it for procurement to initiate the signing process. 20/06/2023- I found out today that the authorized signatory is away until the 4th of July.

They highlighted that the sales system is quite complex and needs simplification, and there is also a necessity to raise the average transaction size. They aspire to enhance the success rates of their customers to better serve their existing clients and uphold their renewal rates. They employ Salesforce and Gong.io, in addition to Outreach, for the initial stages of lead generation. Decided to pursue a demonstration of the proposed solution. The number of uncoordinated sales systems they have is overwhelming. We aim to provide a seamless, integrated platform experience that will let users handle most of their work in one application. 17/12/2022- The NDA has been sent for signature. 20/12/2022- I am still waiting for the NDA to be returned. I've also emailed Jim Jackson, who heads operations, introducing myself and Dealstream, with the intention of maybe bringing him into the scheduled demo session.  23/12/2022- Sent an email to stakeholders urging them to advocate for the NDA, as well as proposing convenient dates and times for the demonstration.  01/01/2023- he NDA was received back and it was mutually agreed upon that the best date for the demonstration would be 7th January 2023. Ken received an email to specify and give us information about those who will be attending the session. 07/01/2023- Everything went well in the demo session. While they appreciated the UI/UX, they declared that integration with their tech stack including Gong must be guaranteed. It's necessary to schedule a call with their team and our product management group to instill confidence that this integration project is feasible. In addition, there was some concern around data privacy which they need their Data Privacy team to look into.  I've urged them to transmit their DPA to us, potentially by the week's end. 14/01/2023- Key Takeaways: Undertook a thorough needs assessment involving Account. Identifying specific difficulties and obstacles they encounter.

Their plan is to have the RFP sent out within the next three weeks, no later than February 28th, 2023. I am liaising with our internal RFP team to prepare a proper template for the client. 21/02/2023- The client received our RFP template, but we discovered our competition includes Humantics AI and FairSale. The client hasn't confirmed they'll use our template, and is yet to provide the RFP document. 28/02/2023- Due to the internal priorities of the stakeholder team, the project has been delayed for a couple of weeks, and so has the RFP document. 07/03/2023- We have received the RFP document which seems to be based on the customer's personal template. Interestingly, it contains several points that coincide with our template. It makes me think that they have used parts of the data I shared with them. And just to update you, the deadline to respond to the RFP is the 21st March 2023, two weeks from today. 14/03/2023- The RFP documentation is still in the process of being completed while we await feedback from Product Marketing about what components can be included in the customer response. Additionally, we are waiting for the data privacy team to finalize the DPA section of the RFP. 20/03/2023- I finalized and submitted our RFP response today, proposing an annual rate of $350K for licenses and an implementation fee of $200K. 25/03/2023-  A meeting has been established, and the client sent out invites for a Q&A on our response - all essential BA side stakeholders must attend. 27/03/2023- The Q and A session unfolded favorably and we responded to every point they had.

Our solution consulting team is in the process of preparing the demo environment internally. 30/03/2023- The conversation I had with my key champion, Geoff Gables who is the VP Sales, revolved around their current internal budgeting process. It appears there are several approval stages with the final approval set for 21st April 2023. They couldn't provide an exact budget but stated it would suffice to cover the solution's requirements. 14/04/2023- Our 4-hour demo session was very productive with all stakeholders present, including Jim Jackson, the Economic Buyer and Head of Operations. We addressed all the key points they raised, along with some questions about service delivery and the Statement of Work (SOW). We agreed on my proposal to develop a value engineering session to formulate a Proof of Value document.

They pointed out that the sales operation is excessively detailed, needing streamlining, and an increase in the average deal size is also necessary. They aim to strengthen their services for existing clients by improving their customer success rates, which would also help maintain their renewal rates. Their early stage lead generation involves the use of Salesforce, Gong.io, and Outreach. Concurred to advance with showing a solution demo. They suffer from having too many unconnected sales systems. Our goal is to provide a smooth and combined platform experience where the user can accomplish much of the work in one program. 17/12/2022- Delivered the NDA for endorsement. 20/12/2022- I've yet to get a returned NDA. Moreover, I emailed Jim Jackson, the chief of operations, to present myself and Dealstream, contemplating his possible participation in our planned demo session. 23/12/2022- Reached out to stakeholders via email to lobby for the NDA and to propose optimal dates/times for the demonstration. 01/01/2023- Ken was tasked, through an email, with identifying and informing us about the attendees for the demonstration session, scheduled for the 7th January 2023 following the return of the NDA. 07/01/2023- The demo session was successful. They communicated their admiration for the UI/UX, but also emphasized the importance of a successful integration with their entire tech stack, particularly Gong. We must set a meeting with their team and our product management department to reassure them that we're capable of carrying out this integration task. In addition, there was some concern around data privacy which they need their Data Privacy team to look into. I have implored them to dispatch their DPA to us, ideally before the end of the week. 14/01/2023- Points of Discussion: Conducted a broad-based needs evaluation with Account. Discussed in detail the particular issues and struggles they deal with. Examined how an AI software solution could potentially solve these issues. 21/01/2023- Organized a discussion forum to go over issues concerning data privacy and security of the AI software solution. We also clarified how the solution fulfills Account' data safety protocols. 22/01/2023- Organized a product demonstration to showcase the distinguishing features of our AI software solution. Explained its possible integration within Account' existing systems to optimize their workflows and operations. 30/01/2023- Responded to questions and resolved issues that appeared following the product demo.

It’s expected to be released over the coming three weeks, but not later than 28th Feb 2023. I'm teaming up with our in-house RFP department to create an RFP template for the client. 21/02/2023- Found out that Humantics AI and FairSale are our competitors after sending the client our RFP template. We haven't heard from them regarding their commitment to our template and we're waiting for them to return the RFP document. 28/02/2023- The project, as well as the RFP document, has been put on hold for a couple of weeks due to the internal priorities of the stakeholder team. 07/03/2023-  I've noticed that the released RFP document, even though based on the customer's own template, shares a number of similarities with ours. They may have included some aspects from the material I previously sent them. Just so it's clear, the deadline for our RFP response is 21st March 2023, which is two weeks from now. 14/03/2023-  A delay in finalizing the RFP documentation is due to us waiting for input from Product Marketing, particularly about our road map and customer-relevant details. Also, the DPA section of the RFP is still to be concluded by our data privacy department. 20/03/2023- As of this morning, our RFP response was submitted, projecting an annual licensing fee of $350K and an implementation cost of $200K. 25/03/2023- A session has been arranged by the client who also sent invites for a Q and A about our response - attendance from all critical stakeholders on the BA side is mandatory. 27/03/2023- The Q and A session went quite positively. We covered each of their queries comprehensively and I put forward the idea of a tailored Post RFP workshop to guide them through a structured demo which mirrors all their operational cases. 28/03/2023- In alignment with the customer's request, we're scheduled to deliver a workshop on the 14th of April. Our solution consulting team is working behind-the-scenes to set up the demo environment. 30/03/2023- Geoff Gables, the VP Sales, and my main contact therein confirmed they're in the midst of appraising their internal budget, which involves multiple approval steps. Their final approval conference is on 21st April 2023. Also, when questioned about the budget they are aiming to get, they indicated it would be adequate to fund the solution's requirements without disclosing the exact number. 14/04/2023- The 4-hour long demo session proceeded exceedingly well with key stakeholders such as Jim Jackson, the Economic Buyer and Head of Operations present.

They made clear their love for the UI/UX while also stressing that integrating with their full tech stack, especially Gong, is a prerequisite. A call has to be set between our product management squad and their team, so as to convince them about the possibility of the integration work. In addition, there was some concern around data privacy which they need their Data Privacy team to look into. They've been asked by me to forward their DPA to us, hopefully before this week concludes. 14/01/2023- Agenda Items: A holistic needs review was performed in collaboration with Account, with a specific focus on their unique challenges.
